The California Ocean Plan and San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board Basin Plan have both designated the area as having special biological significance that warrants particular protection. The State has designated area beaches as impaired for bacteria. There is a critical need to understand the specific pollutants of concern within the watershed, how they may impact the marine ecosystem and how to implement appropriate, site-specific mitigation measures to protect this marine environment. There is also a need to develop a standard for ocean ecosystem monitoring and assessment for long-term protection.","The objectives for the La Jolla Shores Coastal Watershed Management Plan were established by the project partners to address need to protect the water quality of the Plan area.  The objectives consist of:

1.	Identify water quality pollutants of concerns, their potential sources specific to the coastal watershed, and how they may impact the ASBSs.
2.	Identify, evaluate, and prioritize urban runoff management activities, both structural and non-structural in nature, to address the pollutants of concern.
3.	Develop a model for science-oriented, ecosystem-based ASBS assessment and protection that is transferable to other ASBSs statewide.
4.	Create a user-driven data management system at the core of the watershed plan that serves data providers, analysts, partner agencies and the community, and is transferable statewide.

The Bureau of Sanitation does not submit a separate plan.","The water related issues in the region center around water supply, water quality, and moving to sustainable use of water resources within the region.  Many other regions need water supplies that Los Angeles has traditionally used. For Los Angeles to maintain growth, it must reduce per capita consumption of water, and effectively utilize its water resources i.e., rainfall, groundwater and recycled water.  The majority of the water bodies in the urbanized areas of the region are on the EPA 303D list as impaired due to a variety of pollutants.  A TMDL issuance schedule has been mandated and when regulations are promulgated, will dictate the compliance timeframe.  In places, brownfields have impaired groundwater. This is against conflicting desires and perceptions by the public from an outcry against groundwater recharge projects to environmentalists demanding that river flows be maintained even if it is utilizing recylced water discharge to restore habitat.","A Draft Version 1 IRWM Plan has been created that analyzed existing plans and studies in the region against the IRWM program guidelines and developed a set of objectives.  A screening tool was developed for the preliminary ranking of IRWM projects to carry out the strategies needed to address the objectives. A series of five stakeholder meetings were held during development of the Version 1 Plan that allowed for feedback and submission of projects.  Yet a more thorough process is needed to adequately prioritize the objectives and strategies and strongly link these together with the projects.  Thus the objective of this planning grant request is to continue the process that has been initiated, prioritize objectives and strategies, further develop project  conceptualization, and reach a larger cross-section of stakeholders, to more fully formulate the plan.","December 1, 2006","None","Yes",1,

Among the pressures is the growing effort to assure the enhancement of environmental resources within the Sacramento River and its tributaries. Majority of California's water supply originates in the Sacramento Valley, which itself remains a major agricultural center, an area of increased urban growth, and a source of habitat for numerous species.  
Although Sacramento Region water users rely primarily on surface water, groundwater is pumped to augment surface supplies, particularly during dry periods.  Water requirements in the majority of the Sacramento Region subbasins can be met in normal years, but shortages do occur during dry years.  Some entities are anticipated to experience increased shortages in dry periods, with users such as the CVP water service contractors likely to be most affected by contract curtailment provisions.","The Sacramento Region Integrated Regional Water Management Plan contains three main objectives.

1. Integration of water resources management and planning processes in which water interests in the Sacramento Region continue to plan multi-beneficiary programs, projects, and monitoring that will achieve mutual objectives.
2. Institutional and political integration, through which institutional and political alliances of water suppliers and government entities formulate, develop, finance, and implement integrated programs for the common benefit of its members and citizens.  In addition, efforts to continue current and building new political alliances with entities outside the region will strengthen long-term working relationships and foster long-term, viable water management solutions.
3. Operational integration to provide for the coordinated management and operation of facilities and resources to generate the greatest possible benefit from the available resources.","By January 1, 2007","None","Yes",1,

Groundwater is a primary water supply source in the Santa Ana Watershed, but it is threatened by degrading groundwater quality mostly due to high total dissolved solids and nitrates. WMWD and its member agencies are considering a number of projects as part of a regional integrated plan for the Watershed to treat and distribute degraded groundwater to provide an additional source of drinking water and help protect existing groundwater supplies to meet future demands. These types of projects become vital region-wide components to reduce the expanding demand on imported water.","To protect the Western Municipal Water District service area from droughts, improve water quality, and improve local water security by reducing dependence on imported water, the following objectives for the IRWM Plan are proposed:

Programs for water supply reliability, water conservation, and water use efficiency; groundwater recharge and management projects; contaminant and salt removal through reclamation, desalting, and other treatment technologies;
water banking, water exchange, water reclamation, and improvement of water quality; and watershed management planning and implementation.","March 2007","None","Yes",1,

Because of this the Upper Bay is closed to body contact and is severely restricted for fishing. Four TMDLs have been enacted for this watershed and resulted in it's listing as a Critical Coastal Area. Urban runoff has been the identified as a major contributor to water quality degradation, which impacts habitat, beneficial uses, and groundwater interfaces. Water conservation through improved recycling and groundwater basin recharge are two primary goals for water supply issues in this watershed.

The majority of the members of the CBWA have indicated their support of conjunctive use projects in the Basin.  

A dependable long term supply of imported treated and untreated water from the MWD is no longer assured.  Local storage suppolies must be developed to address this problem.

Groundwater quality problems have become more prevalent over the last few years as new contaminants migrate into the underground aquifers, and MCL's have been reduced by DHS and EPA.

In the highly urbanized Los Angeles area, sites for new water wells and treatment plants are becoming more difficult to locate and more expensive to purchase.","It is estimated that the Central Basin currently has 300,000 acre-feet of available storage space.  Central Basin water purveyors are currently involved in a process of developing a conjunctive use groundwater storage program that is both beneficial and agreeable to all entities holding water rights within the Basin.  This project will provide one alternative for those qualified parties to participate in the conjunctive use program.

In addition to the conjunctive use aspect of this project, a new treatment plant will be utilized to remove contaminants (primarily VOC's) from the groundwater when the groundwater is extracted for use in the City.

We chose this region for a Sierra Meadows IRWMP for several reasons. 1) The watersheds in the region face similar issues including: the legacy of mining and its impact on water quality and river health; downstream and out-of-basin demands; and accelerated erosion causing meadows to drain, lowering the water table. 2) The small, rural communities here will define different strategies for IRWM issues than in urban or fast-growing suburban areas. 3) Much of the land in these headwaters is publicly owned, so public land agencies, particularly the USFS and BLM, play a critical role in management of these meadow systems. 4) There are thousands of small reservoirs in this planning area, whose re-operation could foster sustainable management of meadows for a range of uses.","The overall planning objective for the Sierra Meadows IRWMP is to identify and develop integrated Sierra Meadow strategies and projects that meet multiple objectives of water quality, water supply, and environmental enhancement. Some of the initial strategies will be implemented as a result of the studies and analyses that are part of this proposed planning process, whereas others will likely be recommended for implementation by the Plan itself. The water supply objective is to provide reliable and secure water supply through strategic Sierra Meadow management and restoration. The water quality objective is to protect and improve water quality through strategic Sierra Meadow management and restoration. The environmental and habitat protection objective is to protect and restore ecological services associated with Sierra Meadows. These objectives are designed to address statewide priorities, CALFED's goals, and the Non-Point Source Implementation Plan's goals.","The anticipated adoption date for the Sierra Meadows IRWMP is November 15, 2007","Pit Watershed: Pit River Watershed Alliance; Fall River Wild Trout Foundation; Modoc, Lassen, Shasta, and Siskiyou County RCDs; Fall River Resource Conservation District Goose Lake RCD; Pit RCD; and Shasta , Lassen, and Modoc County Farm Bureaus.

Groundwater represents the primary water supply in the region and its extensive use has resulted in groundwater overdraft conditions. Continued overdraft is resulting in adverse community impacts, such as increased pumping costs and loss of well capacity.  The agencies of the region struggle with maintaining the availability and affordability of their water supplies for both domestic and agricultural purposes.
Availability and use of local and imported surface waters has always been affected by annual variations. This condition is typically managed through water purchases and exchanges and groundwater pumping. This situation has been exacerbated recently by a 70 percent reduction in the region's only reservoir due to dam safety concerns. Subsequently, local surface waters are being under utilized, as poor timing correlation between available water supply and agricultural demands exists.","A regional plan that integrates existing and proposed water management strategies is needed and warranted for the optimized reasonable beneficial use of the water resources of the Tule River region. The principal objectives for the adopted IRWM plan will be to address needs, opportunities and conflicts within the region regarding water supply, groundwater management, environmental resources such as habitat/ecosystem restoration and water quality.
Specific objectives for the IRWM Plan will be: to accomplish and maintain region-wide stakeholder participation and communication during implementation; to coordinate local planning and water management efforts; to continue collection, compilation, and maintenance of sufficient regional data and information to support implementation; to identify and implement strategies that achieve the IRWM Plan's objectives; to identify and support potential projects for implementation; and to monitor and evaluate IRWM Plan performance.","December 29, 2006","- Pixley Irrigation District

Sediment and turbidity may also be at unacceptable levels. One challenge is meeting agricultural water demands during the summer. There are several reservoirs in the watershed, but in drought years, many ranchers and farmers in the lower portion of the watershed do not receive water. The restoration of meadow streams and creeks in the upper portions of the watershed would help with this issue. Several fish and wildlife species dependent on riparian and wetland habitats are endemic, or near-endemic, to the watershed including the Modoc sucker, Goose Lake redband, willow flycatcher, and greater sandhill crane. Wetlands and riparian areas provide flood control, ground water recharge, erosion control, and plant and wildlife habitat and their restoration is vital to a healthy ecosystem, community, and economy.","The WMS will identify those issues that are currently limiting or threatening watershed health and important beneficial water uses, better understand what is causing that limitation or threat, identify actions which would eliminate or lessen watershed problems, and garner broad support from the watershed community for that plan of action.  The WMS would include: a) water quality improvement; b) water supply needs for sustainable agriculture, instream flow, and protection/enhancement of aquatic habitat, aquatic species, and recreation; c) protection and enhancement of important aquatic and terrestrial habitat areas, including watercourses, wetlands, marshland, meadows, and upland habitat; d) control of noxious species, including juniper proliferation; and e) restoration needs and opportunities to improve natural channel function and floodplain utilization, reduce channel erosion and instability, and modify hydrology so as to reduce peak flood flows and increase summer time base flows.","January 1, 2007","Hot Springs Irrigation District and

Though the Region usually receives ample winter rain, it lacks extensive groundwater basins or holding facilities to ensure adequate water supply for beneficial uses during the dry summer months. Water shortages occur with increasing frequency, causing conflict between water users and regulatory agencies and among stakeholders with different needs.

Most of the Region's water bodies are impaired; these impairments are mostly related to sedimentation and temperature increases resulting from resource extraction, road building, development, and other human activities. Leaking septic tanks and municipal discharges also cause biological impairments.  Some municipalities or agencies that are in non-compliance with required water quality standards cannot afford to bring their operations to the required level of compliance.  Due to this situation, the Region faces environmental justice issues.","The NCIRWMP objectives are to regionally synchronize local planning processes, institutionalize the regional water management planning framework promoted by the CA State Legislature, provide a basis for coordinated, watershed-based, project planning and implementation, and to produce Phase II of the NCIRWMP. Through implementation of projects that meet local needs and objectives and meet regional and state priorities, we intend to be a model for other WQCB Regions.

The NCIRWMP Phase II planning and management activities will move the NC Region towards achieving the following thematic objectives: enhancement of beneficial uses, maintenance of regional cooperation, and recovery of endangered salmonid populations. By pursuing these objectives through implementation of prioritized projects, we intend to facilitate reduction of water-related conflict, promote environmental justice, improve the Region's water quality, and increase water supply to benefit all inhabitants of the Region.","The North Coast Integration Regional Water Management Plan Phase I will be adopted in July 2005.","Currently, 71 entities have signed the Memorandum of Mutual Understanding (MOMU) indicating their intent to participate in the NCIRWMP Phase I.

Groundwater management plan will be adopted by July 1, 2006.","The four major water related issues in the Region include: groundwater overdraft, water supply relibility for current water uses and pending urban development, environmental preservation of existing environmental habitat, and protecting water quality. The Madera Groundwater Subbasin has been identified as a basin in 'Critical Overdraft' for over 25 years.  Current estimates identify the annual overdraft at 100,000 acre-feet per year.  In addition to water supply reliability concerns, the declining groundwater levels may result in poorer groundwater quality, because groundwater quality in the basin decreases with depth.  
The Region is under heavy pressure of urban development.  Existing planned developments require a high level groundwater supply reilability and water quality to meet their future water needs.  With the increasing development, only a few large contiguous areas are available to preserve existing habitat and local wildlife areas.","The objectives for the Plan include improving the Region's long-term water supply reliability, reducing groundwater overdraft and protecting the groundwater basin, protecting and preserving the environmental resources of the Region, and protecting surface water and groundwater quality.  The Plan will help reduce conflicts in the Region by encouraging the local agencies to work together to solve regional water supply issues.  Implementing regional water management strategies will reduce the stress on the San Joaquin River system and improve dry and critical year water supply for the Region.","August 2006","During the intial development of the Regional Water Management Group, The City of Madera and Gravelly Ford Water District expressed an interest in joining the RWMG.

Though the Region usually receives ample winter rain, it lacks extensive groundwater basins or holding facilities to ensure adequate water supply for beneficial uses during the dry summer months. Water shortages occur with increasing frequency, causing conflict between water users and regulatory agencies and among stakeholders with different needs. Most of the Region's water bodies are impaired; these impairments are mostly related to sedimentation and temperature increases resulting from resource extraction, road building, development, and other human activities. Leaking septic tanks and municipal discharges also cause biological impairments. Some municipalities or agencies that are in non-compliance with required water quality standards cannot afford to bring their operations to the required level of compliance. Due to this situation, the Region faces environmental justice issues.","The NCIRWMP objectives are to regionally synchronize local planning processes, institutionalize the regional water management planning framework promoted by the CA State Legislature, provide a basis for coordinated, watershed-based, project planning and implementation, and to produce Phase II of the NCIRWMP. Through implementation of projects that meet local needs and objectives and meet regional and state priorities, we intend to be a model for other WQCB Regions. The NCIRWMP Phase II planning and management activities will move the NC Region towards achieving the following thematic objectives: enhancement of beneficial uses, maintenance of regional cooperation, and recovery of endangered salmonid populations. By pursuing these objectives through implementation of prioritized projects, we intend to facilitate reduction of water-related conflict, promote environmental justice, improve the Region's water quality, and increase water supply to benefit all inhabitants of the Region.","The adoption date of July 12, 2005 for a Regional Water Management Group was formed from mutual interest and benefit and by County Board Resolutions, Modoc County Authorizing Resolution No. 05-26, Humboldt County Authorizing Resolution No. 05-45, Siskiyou County Authorizing Resolution No. 05-94, Sonoma County and Sonoma County Water Agency Authorizing Resolution No.05-0650, Del Norte County Authorizing Resolution No. 05-39 See Attachment 3: Authorizing Documentation.","Currently, over 71 entities have signed the Memorandum of Mutual Understanding (MOMU) indicating their intent to participate in the NCIRWMP Phase I.

City of San Fernando, et al., dated January 26, 1979 (Judgment).  This Judgment creates compliance with CWC Section 10753 regarding groundwater management plans.  The Superior Court appointed a Watermaster of the Upper Los Angeles River Area to administer and enforce the terms of the Judgment on behalf of the Superior Court.  The Watermaster is also responsible for accounting for all groundwater extractions, recharge operations, stored water credits, groundwater quality, and hydrologic condition within the San Fernando Basin.","The water related issues in the region center around water supply, water quality, and moving to sustainable use of water resources within the region. Many other regions need water supplies that Los Angeles has traditionally used. For Los Angeles to maintain growth, it must reduce per capita consumption of water, and effectively utilize its water resources i.e., rainfall, groundwater and recycled water. The majority of the water bodies in the urbanized areas of the region are on the EPA 303D list as impaired due to a variety of pollutants. A TMDL issuance schedule has been mandated and when regulations are promulgated, will dictate the compliance timeframe. In places, brownfields have impaired groundwater. This is against conflicting desires and perceptions by the public from an outcry against groundwater recharge projects to environmentalists demanding that river flows be maintained even if it is utilizing recycled water discharge to restore habitat.","A Draft Version 1 IRWM Plan has been created that analyzed existing plans and studies in the region against the IRWM program guidelines and developed a set of objectives. A screening tool was developed for the preliminary ranking of IRWM projects to carry out the strategies needed to address the objectives. A series of five stakeholder meetings were held during development of the Version 1 Plan that allowed for feedback and submission of projects. Yet a more thorough process is needed to adequately prioritize the objectives and strategies and strongly link these together with the projects.","December 1, 2006","None","Yes",1,1

City of Clovis, City of Dinuba, Fresno Irrigation District and Raisin City Water District are participating in the development of an IRWM plan that meets the requirements of CWC §10753.7","During dry years surface water supplies are often insufficient and the region relies on increased groundwater pumping to meet all the water demands, resulting in storage depletion, overdraft, declining water levels, and loss of groundwater supply in some areas in the eastern part of the Kings Basin. Degradation of water quality in parts of the region has the potential to reduce the available supply or increase treatment costs and migration of poor quality water is a factor in the operation of the groundwater basin. Significant urban development is occurring throughout the region, increasing demands and creating potential for conflicts between water users. Potential conflicts also exist due to inconsistent planning horizons, lack of compatibility between land use and water supply plans, decreased water quality, increased treatment costs and requirements for both drinking water and wastewater treatment.","Water resources objectives have been developed to address priority water supply problems by integrating land, water, and environmental management strategies that will provide multiple benefits and the greatest return on investment. The preliminary water management objectives are: Find regional opportunities for groundwater recharge, water reuse/reclamation, and drinking water treatment; Improve the ability to store available surface and storm water; Provide multi-purpose groundwater recharge facilities that provide flood control, recreation and ecosystem benefits and integrate the fishery management plan; Promote in-lieu groundwater recharge through reclamation and reuse of treated wastewater; Surface water treatment and delivery for drinking water; and untreated water for agricultural use; Design programs to improve water conservation and water use efficiency by all water users; and enhance wildlife habitat through surface water reclamation, recharge, and treatment facilities.","The Kings Basin IRWMP will be adopted by the project participants by January 1,2007 in compliance with the requirements of the Proposition 50, Chapter 8 grant funding.","City of Fowler, Mayor Jim Simonian;City of Kingsburg, City Manager Don Pauley;City of Reedley, Interim City Engineer Bruce Webber; City of Sanger, Deputy Director of Public Works Tim Chapa City of Selma, Community and Volunteer Coordinator Roseann Galvan;City of Kerman, City Manager Ron Manfredi; City of Parlier, City Manager Lou Martinez;County of Fresno, Senior Geologist Phil Desatoff;County of Kings, Board of Supervisor Jon Rachford;County of Tulare, Brian Haddox;Fresno Audubon Society, Joseph Oldman;California Native Plant Society, Warren Shaw;Kings River Fisheries Management Program Public Advisory Group, Hank Urbach;El Rio Reyes Trust, Kent Kinney;California Water Institute, Karl Longely; California Department of Fish & Game, Bill Loudermilk;Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lonnie Wass;Kings River Water Association, Steve Haugen","Yes","N/A",1,1

MCWRA is responsible for the management of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin. MCWRA has prepared reports and implemented programs that supported the requirements of CWC - 10753. In summary, MCWRA has implemented programs that addressed the following criteria: The control of saline water intrusion; implementation of a nitrate management plan, identification and management of wellhead protection and recharge areas; administration of a well abandonment and well destruction program; mitigation of conditions of overdraft; replenishment of groundwater extracted by water producers; monitoring of groundwater levels and storage; facilitation of conjunctive use operations; development of local relationships with state and federal regulatory agencies; and review of land use plans and coordination with land use planning agencies to assess activities which create a reasonable risk of groundwater contamination.","The Salinas Valley Region is approximately delineated by the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin (Basin). The Basin has been identified as contaminated with seawater intrusion since 1946. Excess groundwater pumping has led to overdraft and expansion of the seawater intrusion line. In addition, Marina Coast Water District, responsible for the delivery of water to the former Fort Ord, has encountered groundwater contamination issues due to seawater intrusion and volatile organic compounds contamination. The city of Soledad currently disposes its treated wastewater to stabilization ponds. This in turn can lead to nitrate contamination in the groundwater, already exacerbated by the intense 3 billion dollar agricultural business in the Salinas Valley. The proposed projects focus on resolving the above issues.","The Salinas Valley (IRWM) Plan objectives focus on four criteria: water supply, water quality, flood protection and environmental enhancement. A short objectives summary is provided. Water supply objectives are: Stop seawater intrusion, provide sufficient water supply to meet all water needs through the year 2030, optimize conjunctive use and increase groundwater storage. Water quality objectives are: Meet or exceed all applicable water quality regulatory standards, aid in meeting TMDL•s established for the Salinas River watershed, protect surface and groundwater from contamination or threat of contamination. Flood protection objectives are: Preserve flood protection associated with dam operations and work with stakeholders to preserve existing flood channel maintenance program. Environmental enhancement objectives are: Minimize adverse environmental impacts, identify opportunities to protect, enhance, and/or restore natural resources including streams, groundwater and watersheds.","The functionally equivalent plan (FEP) was adopted by the Boards of all member agencies in June of 2005 and is described in detail in attachment # 3.

Implementing agency:  Pleasant Valley Water District","PVWD•s GMP was adopted on 05/09/00, prior to the passage of SB1938 which was incorporated in CWC10753. The 2000 Plan was prepared in accordance with the requirements prescribed in AB3030 (CWC10750 et seq). In 2003 the District was awarded a grant from the Local Groundwater Management Assistance Act (AB303). One task funded by the grant was to update the GMP.

A draft of the updated or revised Plan was prepared in April 2005 to include information collected as part the District•s Groundwater Quality Monitoring Program funded under AB303. The April 2005 GMP includes provisions in order to be in compliance with CWC10753.

The draft is available for review by other agencies. The development of the final plan that meets the requirements of CWC10753.7 will be completed July 2006 within 1 year of the grant application submittal date. The initial review by the Pleasant Valley Water District Board of Directors in anticipated to be conducted late summer 2005.","Current CVP contract supplies for the cities are insufficient to meet their needs and PVWD has no long-term water supply. Expansion of environmental and habitat protection and improvement is limited by scarce water supply and land acquisition. Current groundwater quality in much of Pleasant Valley is of moderate to high salinity making it more costly for treatment for municipal use and having potentially negative impacts when used for irrigation or wildlife habitat. Since groundwater overdraft in the underlying basin is a chronic problem, one objective is to provide sufficient groundwater recharge and conservation to reverse existing conditions. The stream, Arroyo Pasajero, causes periodic flooding and temporary closure of Highway 269 in the I-5 Business Development Corridor. The flooding interrupts transportation and requires costly cleanup.","Groundwater banking would improve water quality in two ways. By importing and banking higher quality surface water, and therefore mixing it with the native groundwater, the resulting groundwater extracted in the future would be of higher quality. Second, it will be possible at times to use surface water directly for wildlife habitat, municipal treatment, and irrigation thus providing an alternative to using lower quality groundwater. Imported surface water could be intentionally recharged to the aquifer for later extraction improving water supply reliability. A part of the purchased surface water supplies could also be used directly for irrigation resulting in less groundwater use. It is estimated the total potential banking capacity in Pleasant Valley to be approximately 1,000,000 acre-feet. Through storm water capture by groundwater banking and resultant infiltration the severity of flooding of the Arroyo Pasajero could be reduced.","Not yet adopted.

The Plan includes a management strategy for San Juan Basin surface and groundwater and includes management objectives, a map of the groundwater basin, flow and quality of water, monitoring, and incorporates geologic and hydrologic principles. The Plan maps out the construction of the Phase I 4 mgd desalter, and five extraction wells. Phase I has been implemented. Phase II will expand the desalter to 8 mgd and a total of 12 extraction wells.","Approximately 94% of South Orange County•s potable water supply is imported from Northern California and the Colorado River. This water is treated over 40 miles away and delivered via two aging pipelines. In addition, surface water and groundwater as potable or non-potable sources is minimal. The Region endures very limited storage capacity, with the total calculated storage capacity of the San Juan Creek Groundwater Basin estimated at 90,000 acre-feet, which is limited due to potential sea water intrusion, economic reasons, or poor water quality. In South Orange County, four portions of rivers or streams, five coastal shorelines and beaches, two estuaries, and one harbor in South Orange County were identified on the 2002 303(d) list.  Pollutants and stressors for the region are primarily bacteria indicators, phosphorus, toxicity, and turbidity. Thus, water supply reliability and water quality are major issues for south Orange County.","The objective of the IRWM Plan is to identify integrated projects to improve water quality and supply in order to investigate their feasibility, engage in long range water planning, to establish priorities among the proposals of the member entities and obtain potential funding.  The IRWM Plan focuses primarily on the projects and plans of the member agencies, with an emphasis on long-term water supply and water quality issues facing the South Orange County region over the next 20 to 50 years. All projects within the plan are essential to maximizing limited water resources, protecting water quality, and enhancing the environment.

Kaweah Delta Water Conservation District is conducting a project to update its existing Groundwater Management Plan to be consistent with current CWC requirements.  Other agencies participating in implementation of recharge projects are signatories to the District's Groundwater Management Plan.","The Basin's major water issues and management needs consist of groundwater overdraft mitigation and management, water supply reliability and storm water management. Groundwater represents the primary water supply for domestic and agricultural uses with the region. Its extensive use has resulted in groundwater overdraft conditions. Groundwater management remains necessary to address the impacts of region-wide population growth and agricultural needs. Ensuring adequate water supply to the domestic and agricultural uses within the region, as well as for recharge purposes, will mitigate groundwater overdraft. Maximizing the availability and use of surface water reduces the need to pump groundwater. Storm and flood water capture represent an additional opportunity to augment existing surface water supplies and provide water for groundwater recharge.","The primary goal of the District and its regional partners is to maintain the balance of surface and groundwater supplies in the region. The District considers these efforts, including its adopted Groundwater Management Plan, water management agreements and supporting elements to constitute a functionally equivalent IRWM Plan.  The District has led Basin-wide activities to achieve the goals and objectives of the IRWM Plan. The objectives are focused around conserving and storing the surface water of the Kaweah River and protecting the groundwater supply of the Basin.  The objectives are achieved through a combination of surface water importation, groundwater recharge, conservation, water supply management and activities to determine the feasibility of integrating groundwater recharge, flood protection, storm water detention and wildlife habitat enhancement efforts. The District's activities also include groundwater level monitoring and monitoring of surface water transfers.","July 5, 1995","Current Groundwater Management Plan participants:  Consolidate Peoples Ditch Company, St. Johns Water District, Lakeside Ditch Company, Kings County Water District, City of Farmersville, City of Tulare, Ivanhoe Irrigation District.","Yes",1,1

The land use water demand issues arise due to urban growth and land use changes that cause increased water demands on an already strained system.  This conflict can be between urban development, agricultural interests, and environmental stewards.  Regional issues include groundwater pumping in the Central Basin that has provided a safe, reliable, inexpensive water supply but has had environmental effects, such as the lowering of the water table, reduced stream flows and habitat, and a cone of depression.  Additionally, EBMUD American River water rights created concern in the Sacramento Area for long-term impacts on flows and resources in the American River.","Objectives of the CSSCRWP are described thoroughly in the Functionally Equivalent Plan. Their mission is to preserve the economic, environmental health and well-being of the region through watershed stewardship and comprehensive management of water resources in a reliable, cost effective and responsible manner.

Among the pressures is the growing effort to assure the enhancement of environmental resources within the Sacramento River and its tributaries. Majority of California's water supply originates in the Sacramento Valley, which itself remains a major agricultural center, an area of increased urban growth, and a source of habitat for numerous fish and waterfowl species. Although Sacramento Region water users rely primarily on surface water, groundwater is pumped to augment surface supplies, particularly during dry periods. Water requirements in the majority of the Sacramento Region subbasins can be met in normal years, but shortages do occur during dry years. Some entities are anticipated to experience increased shortages in dry periods, with users such as the CVP water service contractors likely to be most affected by contract curtailment provisions.","The Sacramento Region Integrated Regional Water Management Plan contains three main objectives. 1. Integration of water resources management and planning processes in which water interests in the Sacramento Region continue to plan multi-beneficiary programs, projects, and monitoring that will achieve mutual objectives. 2. Institutional and political integration, through which institutional and political alliances of water suppliers and government entities formulate, develop, finance, and implement integrated programs for the common benefit of its members and citizens. In addition, efforts to continue current and building new political alliances with entities outside the region will strengthen long-term working relationships and foster long-term, viable water management solutions. 3. Operational integration to provide for the coordinated management and operation of facilities and resources to generate the greatest possible benefit from the available resources.","Sacramento Valley water users have implemented a number of programs that can be considered functionally equivalent plans and are the building blocks and precursors to the development of the Sacramento Valley Integrated Regional Water Management Plan.  In December 2000, the NCWA Board of Directors adopted a strategy for an "Integrated Water Management and Water Supply Program" that was developed by the water districts and counties throughout the Sacramento Valley.  In 2001, Sacramento Valley water users, Export Water Users and State and Federal agencies entered into an agreement to stay the SWRCB's Phase 8 proceedings and develop a cooperative water management partnership to help meet water quality objectives in the Delta.  In December 2002, more than 40 Sacramento Valley districts executed and thus adopted the Short-Term Settlement Agreement, building upon the effort initiated by the Short-Term Stay Agreement.

A refined Sacramento Valley IRWMP will be adopted by January 1, 2007.","There will be broad outreach efforts to entities in the Sacramento Valley to increase input into the plan and the process.","Yes",1,1

The following six key water management issues emerged from this process:
1) Demand Exceeds Supply. The projected year 2020 water balance shows a water deficit in MWA service area of over 50,000 acre-feet per year. 2) Water Quality. Water quality problems affect drinking water supplies throughout the MWA the region. 3) Overdraft of the Groundwater Basins. Declining groundwater levels occur in all subareas. 4) Riparian Ecosystem Maintenance. 5) Wastewater Infrastructure. Wastewater infrastructure issues affect the two subareas with the largest urban water demands within the Mojave Basin Area. 6) Subarea Interaction. Many subareas within the MWA service area are impacted by activities in other subareas. These impacts include water supply and water quality issues.","The Technical Advisory Committee recommended the following Basin Management Objectives (consistant with GWMP requirements) which the MWA Board of Directors adopted as the basis of the IRWMP included; 1) Balance future water demands with supplies, recognizing the need to: stabilize GW storage balance over long-term hydrologic cycles, protect and restore riparian habitat areas, limit potential for well dewatering, land subsidence, and poor quality water, maintain a sustainable water supply through extended drought periods; and, select projects with likelihood of being implemented.  2) Maximize the overall beneficial use of water throughout MWA by: supplying water is quantity and quality, address demand management issues, distribution of benefits equitably, ensure costs provide greatest benefits, avoid redirect impacts, and identify sustainable funding sources.

The Feather River supplies the State Water Project and supports hydroelectric operations of Pacific Gas & Electric Company, giving the State of California as well as PG&E and its regulators significant interests and responsibilities in the region.  Also, 50 percent of the watershed is owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service, for which watershed enhancement is a central mission.  

With so many competing interests and issues within the region and from outside, the primary challenge is to develop the science, data, and stakeholder coordination - and to identify responsibilities and funding sources - to manage the watershed on a comprehensive basis rather than one stream, one FERC license, or one species at a time.","The IRWM Plan for the Upper Feather River pulls together the many planning activities and projects that have been undertaken in the region over the past two decades. The IRWM partners have reviewed the existing land and water management plans for the Feather River region, identified any conflicts or gaps in planning, and consolidated the different plans into a guiding document with regional perspective.

The specific objectives of the IRWM Plan are to improve local water retention and reduce flood damage and the need to spill reservoirs; improve dry-season base flows; improve water quality to reduce sediment and temperature, meet the Central Valley Basin Plan standards, and satisfy the agricultural waiver program; improve upland vegetation management to improve water quality and water retention and reduce erosion; improve groundwater retention and storage in major aquifers; and be able to accommodate a restored salmon fishery in segments of the Upper Feather River watershed.","The IRWM Plan was adopted through an MOU with an effective date of July 1, 2007.

PVWMA feels its actions are legally defensible; in contrast to typical municipal purveyor, use of groundwater by PVWMA is part of overall strategy of programs and projects that, when implemented, will increase sustainable yield of groundwater basin.

The TSP will implement high priority water quality/supply improvement projects by developing strong working partnerships, consolidating efforts, and transferring data and knowledge.  The high priority projects were selected for their geographic scopes; ability to achieve multiple benefits, obtain objectives and meet statewide priorities; and strength of partnership commitments.

On the Truckee River and at Lake Tahoe, a similar Decree has installed a Federal water master to govern the lake levels behind the outlet dam in Tahoe City.  The partnership does not expect any conflicts over water supply objectives due to the designation of the decrees described above.",1,2

This Proposal will directly address this through developing additional water supply, resolving drainage issues for about 100,000 acres of highly saline lands and improving water quality in the San Joaquin River.

Additionally:
Ecosystem Restoration - reduction in selenium loads affecting aquatic and avian life
Environmental and Habitat Protection - reduction in pollutant loads
Water Supply Reliability - Creation of a net water supply benefit of about 58,000 AFY on average and 41,000 AFY in critical years
Groundwater Management - utilization of unused groundwater
Water Conservation - irrigation efficiency improvements
Water Quality Improvement - allows achievement of Salinity/Boron TMDL and improvement toward Selenium TMDL","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","The project will reduce historic conflict between water users represented by the San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors and Districts within the San Luis Unit of the CVP, as well as downstream water users in the lower San Joaquin River and Delta.  By removing about 240,000 tons per year of salts from drainage to the San Joaquin River, modeling has shown that salinity objectives for salinity at Vernalis can be consistently achieved and greatly improved at downstream locations.  This modeling shows also that in dry years about 23,000 AF of water would otherwise be available in New Melones Reservoir for other purposes due to a reduction in the need for water quality releases from this reservoir due to implementation of the Westside Regional Drainage Plan.  Further,the groundwater management portion of the Proposal will intercept a  saline plume of groundwater migrating toward municipal supply wells serving the City of Firebaugh.",1,2

Conjunctive water management projects include groundwater production wells, recharge, and monitoring to ensure that local needs are met in a sustainable manner while helping to protect and enhance the ecosystem and meet water quality standards and water supply needs in other parts of the State. Elements of these projects were developed by local proponents to provide broad local, regional, and statewide water supply reliability, and water quality benefits as well as increased Sacramento River flows. System improvement projects include water district improvements to increase water use efficiency, improve system automation, increase local supplies, and generally improve water management to assist in improving water quality and reliability and reduce river and stream diversions.","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Nine of the projects contained in this Proposal were conceived as part of the Sacramento Valley Water Management Agreement (SVWMA) that will "reduce conflict between water users or resolve water rights disputes, including interregional water rights issues." This Proposal is the first major step in implementation of the SVWMA and development of long-term resolution of water rights disputes among Sacramento Valley right holders and Delta exporters. In 2002, more than 40 water suppliers in the Sacramento Valley negotiated and executed the SVWMA with the Bureau of Reclamation, DWR, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the State Water Project Contractors. The SVWMA provides a framework for resolution of water rights disputes in the Sacramento Valley and offers a means of developing additional water supply to help meet Delta water quality standards.",1,2

This decline will result in an increase in the use of power and energy resources to pump groundwater, creating both an environmental and economic burden. This economic burden will be felt by all uses that rely in whole or in part on pumped groundwater --- whether use is for agricultural, municipal, or industrial purposes. All of the communities within the Region are economically-disadvantaged communities that rely exclusively on groundwater for their municipal drinking water source.  If conflict over reduced water supplies is to be avoided, actions to mitigate the reduction in surface water supplies available to the Region must be taken.","The Plan objectives include...
1. Maintain and improve water supply reliability;(based on the findings of this Plan, this objective means to mitigate the projected loss to water supply reliability since it may not be possible to improve beyond the historical condition)
2. Maintain groundwater levels at economically viable pumping lifts;
3. Protect the quality of groundwater and enhance where practical;
4. Maintain water supply costs at a level commensurate with the continued viability of the agricultural economy which has developed in the region;

In addition, since the La Jolla Shores beach is a SWRCB 303(d) listed water body for bacteria contamination with a TMDL currently under development, the Plan also significantly reduces pollution in impaired waters.  Therefore, according to the June 2007 IRWM Round 2 Grant Program Guidelines, Section C, this ICWM Plan is eligible for an exception to the maximum grant amount of $25M per region.

The most critical project to help solve these issues is the Los Osos Community Wastewater Project.   The Santa Maria Groundwater Basin has been adjudicated, with seawater intrusion concerns.   Multiple 303(d) listings exist for Nipomo Creek, Oso Flaco Creek, Oso Flaco Lake, and the Santa Maria River.  Mechanisms to fund vital flood control projects, especially in the disadvantaged community of Oceano, prove challenging.

-Existing imbalance of areas oh high and low groundwater
-Pending imbalance of supply and demand due to planned growth
-Exisitng and pending inability to adequately dispose of wastewater
-Frequent reduction of long-term imported water supplies and lower quality local supplies.

Water Quality

-Increased total disolved solids (TDS) salts are accumulating in the basin and constrain beneficial uses
-Hardness affects urban supplies and leads to water softeners that further add salts to the basin
-Nitrates have accumulated in some groundwater sub-basins, affecting beneficial uses
-Effective water quality protection is lacking

Lack of adequate surface water; 
Groundwater overdraft; 
Migration of saline groundwater;

Supply reliability during multi-year droughts; 
Competing urban, agricultural, and environmental water demands; 
Expansion of agriculture into historically un-irrigated areas; 
Sustainability of economies dependent water supply; 
Flood protection; and 
Funding and financing.

Because the Management Area is part of a regional aquifer system, integrated regional solutions are essential to solve key regional issues while avoiding or minimizing conflict.  No one solution will fully address the underlying issues facing the area.  The solution requires an integrated mix of water management strategies. Failure to address water supply and management needs will ultimately result in severe social, economic, and environmental disruptions to the Region.","IRWMP Chapter 5 displays the Plan statements of the problem, GBA mission, Plan purpose, objectives, and values, plus evaluation and prioritization criteria.  These are considered in the Plan as a hierarchy, such that each level must address an aspect of the levels above.  Groundwater overdraft and resulting saline water migration threaten the sustainability and reliability of the region's water supply.  The GBA Coordinating Committee developed the following statement of the Fundamental Objectives (p.5-3):
It is the Objective of the GBA to: Ensure the long-term sustainability of water resources in the San Joaquin Region while: 
Equitably distributing benefits and costs; Minimizing adverse impacts to agriculture, communities, and the environment; Maximizing efficiency and beneficial use of supplies; and, Protecting and enhancing water rights and supplies.

Water Quantity- water diversion, water demand, infrastructure, groundwater. 
Habitat and Restoration: instream flow, habitat alteration, fisheries and aquatic biota, and fire and fuels.","The CABY IRWMP goals and objectives were formulated in work groups for the water supply, water quality, environment and habitat, land use, and recreation management areas.

Water supply- water supply reliability, balancing needs for water, water quality/safe drinking water, agricultural water supply reliability, and global climate change.  

Groundwater management- groundwater conditions, groundwater quality, and groundwater management.  

Water quality- impaired water quality, impacts to beneficial uses, pathogens, mercury, sedimentation, nutrients, on-site sewage disposal systems, and ASBS areas.  

Storm water and flood management- municipal storm water management, flood management, impervious surfaces, and water supply interruption. 

Ecosystems and habitat- Tomales Bay, habitat and special status species protection, freshwater flows, Coho salmon and steelhead recovery, fishery spawning and sedimentation, wetlands, riparian habitat, and exotic species.   

Watershed management- water quality monitoring, fishery monitoring, landuse practices, partnerships, and additional data needs/data gaps.","The Plan identified five programmatic goals (water quality, environmental restoration and habitat improvement, water supply reliability, stormwater and flood management, and groundwater management) as well as an overarching guiding approach (sound resource and watershed management). 

Each goal has at least three objectives to direct implementation and project development. In the aggregate, the objectives ensure water quality is sufficient to support natural resources and sustain beneficial uses, that natural habitats and native communities are restored and preserved, that stormwater and flood management programs and measures are sound and environmentally sensitive, that groundwater supplies are managed and protected, and that sound water resource management processes and infrastructure are met while balancing the diverse water needs of the region.","The Tomales Bay Watershed Council is comprised of 32 member groups, including all four regional water agencies with service area boundaries in the region. TBWC members include federal, state, and local agencies with regulatory or management authority in the region, local organizations, and non-profit organizations with a programmatic focus in the plan area.  The stakeholders in the TBWC have been working together since 2000 and have jointly produced the Tomales Bay Watershed Stewardship Plan, which is the precursor document to the ICWMP.  Therefore all agencies and organizations that participate in resource management decisions in the region will continue to participate in the planning process, and in implementation of the plan recommendations.","IRWM Water Management Round 2 Grant Program Guidelines: II Introduction and Overview: C Maximum Grant Amount

Though the Region usually receives ample winter rain, it lacks extensive groundwater basins or holding facilities to ensure adequate water supply for beneficial uses during the dry summer months. Water shortages occur with increasing frequency, causing conflict between water users and regulatory agencies and among stakeholders with different needs. Most of the Region's water bodies are impaired; these impairments are mostly related to sedimentation and temperature increases resulting from resource extraction, road building, development, and other human activities. Leaking septic tanks and municipal discharges also cause biological impairments. Some municipalities or agencies that are in non-compliance with required water quality standards cannot afford to bring their operations to the required level of compliance. As a result, this disadvantaged Region faces environmental justice issues.","The NCIRWMP objectives are to regionally synchronize local inland and coastal planning processes, institutionalize the regional water management planning framework promoted by the CA State Legislature, provide a basis for coordinated, watershed-based, project planning and implementation, and to produce ongoing, adaptive phases of the NCIRWMP. Through implementation of projects that meet local needs and objectives and meet regional and state priorities, we intend to be a model for other DWR and RWQCB Regions. The integrated coastal management activities put forth in this proposal will further progress towards the following thematic objectives: enhancement of beneficial uses, maintenance of regional cooperation, and recovery of endangered salmonid populations. The proposal promotes environmental justice, improves the Region's water quality, reduces pollution to ASBS and CCAs to benefit all inhabitants of the Region.","Currently, 71 entities have signed the Memorandum of Mutual Understanding (MOMU) indicating their intent to participate in the NCIRWMP Phase I. These entities include 16 municipalities, several Resource Conservation Districts, 2 tribal agencies, numerous CSDs, Water Agencies and Sanitary Districts, and many non-profit and community-based organizations.

Significant urban development is occurring throughout the region, increasing demands and creating potential for conflicts between water users. Potential conflicts also exist due to inconsistent planning horizons, lack of compatability between land use and water supply plans, decreased water quality, increased treatment costs and requirements for both drinking water and wastewater treatment.

In 1966, the court ruled that states controlled water rights and directed Camp Pendleton and FPUD to sign a memorandum of understanding to divide the flows. Initial efforts focused on dam construction. In 1977, Camp Pendleton and FPUD assigned their water rights to the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). In 1988, the two parties abandoned dam construction and began development of a conjunctive use project with USBR that has evolved to the SMCUP.

The results of the adjudication will help provide important clarity and certainty between groundwater users about how the groundwater resources will be managed. The adjudication process is expected to result in a plan, to stabilize groundwater levels and prevent further damage that can result from declining groundwater levels; this may include restrictions to type and quantity of recharge allowed in the basin. Since both of the above mentioned projects involve an element of groundwater recharge, any restrictions for recharge arising from the adjudication has the potential to impact their future operation/implementation. Although there are no existing restrictions on pumping, it may be altered or reduced as part of the adjudication.","YES","YES, all fields have been completed.",2,2
