The agencies and stakeholders in the Region are preparing an IRWMP with the understanding that through regional integration| more cost effective and broader-reaching water management solutions can be developed and implemented.","","","West Basin Municipal Water District","","17140 S.

The general area is also designated as a Critical Coastal Area. The City of Trinidad and its neighbors have come together as a group of stakeholders committed to taking care of their watersheds and ultimately protecting the shared resource of Trinidad ASBS. The approach to achieve this goal is to identify the pollutants of concern through watershed assessments and water quality monitoring| and then formulate an action plan that identifies specific projects to help reduce or eliminate those pollutants at their source. The action plan will be part of an area-wide watershed management plan prepared by the stakeholders. This effort will result in an update of the City's General Plan as a watershed planning document.","","","City of Trinidad","","P.O. 390 | Trinidad | CA - 95570","41.06                            Longitude:                          -124.11","Multiple","Humboldt","1 North Coast Regional Water Board","500|000.00","45|546.00","545|546.00","Integrated Coastal Watershed Management Planning Grant/Integrated Regional Water Management Planning Grant","Yes/No","500,000.00/.00","Project Director: Authorized Representative from Applicant Organization to execute funding agreement/Project Manager: Day to day contact on this project from Applicant Organization","Chi-Wei/","Lin/","/","/","/","City of Trinidad","","P.O. 390

The lower two-thirds of the drainage area lie in Central Valley uplands| and the upstream portion includes the east slope of the North Coast Mountain Range and Klamath Mountains and the southern slopes of the Trinity Mountains. The mainstem of Cottonwood Creek flows eastward through the valley to the Sacramento River| the confluence lying approximately 16 miles north of Red Bluff. The watershed drains approximately 938 square miles. With an annual runoff of 586|000 acre-feet| Cottonwood Creek is the third largest watershed tributary west of the Sacramento River and the largest undammed tributary in the upper Sacramento River basin.

The group began initial discussions regarding each entity¿s respective water issues| and soon realized many shared objectives for the entire region.  The group understands the complicated nature and interdependence of the CABY watersheds| and all support the need for an integrated planning effort to develop solutions that support the common and individual objectives for the region.
