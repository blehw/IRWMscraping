This area is highly valued for its diverse and fragile marine ecosystem and for the recreational opportunities it provides. The California Ocean Plan and San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board Basin Plan have both designated the area as having special biological significance that warrants particular protection. The State has designated area beaches as impaired for bacteria. There is a critical need to understand the specific pollutants of concern within the watershed, how they may impact the marine ecosystem and how to implement appropriate, site-specific mitigation measures to protect this marine environment. There is also a need to develop a standard for ocean ecosystem monitoring and assessment for long-term protection.","The objectives for the La Jolla Shores Coastal Watershed Management Plan were established by the project partners to address need to protect the water quality of the Plan area.  The objectives consist of:

1.	Identify water quality pollutants of concerns, their potential sources specific to the coastal watershed, and how they may impact the ASBSs.
2.	Identify, evaluate, and prioritize urban runoff management activities, both structural and non-structural in nature, to address the pollutants of concern.
3.	Develop a model for science-oriented, ecosystem-based ASBS assessment and protection that is transferable to other ASBSs statewide.
4.	Create a user-driven data management system at the core of the watershed plan that serves data providers, analysts, partner agencies and the community, and is transferable statewide.
5.	Encourage stewardship of the ASBSs through a pioneering  public involvement and outreach strategy that utilizes University tools and science.","The La Jolla Shores Coastal Watershed Management Plan is scheduled for adoption prior to January 1, 2007.","San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board, State Water Resources Control Board, California Coastal Commission, California Department of Fish and Game, California Coastal Conservancy, The Ocean Conservancy, Southern California Coastal Water Research Project, Birch Aquarium","Yes"
