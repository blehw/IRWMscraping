The general area is also designated as a Critical Coastal Area. The City of Trinidad and its neighbors have come together as a group of stakeholders committed to taking care of their watersheds and ultimately protecting the shared resource of Trinidad ASBS. The approach to achieve this goal is to identify the pollutants of concern through watershed assessments and water quality monitoring, and then formulate an action plan that identifies specific projects to help reduce or eliminate those pollutants at their source. The action plan will be part of an area-wide watershed management plan prepared by the stakeholders. This effort will result in an update of the City's General Plan as a watershed planning document.","","","City of Trinidad","","P.O. 390 , Trinidad , CA - 95570","41.0","Multiple","Humboldt","1 North Coast Regional Water Board","500,000.00","45,546.00","545,546.00",Integrated Coastal Watershed Management Planning Grant Integrated Regional Water Management Planning Grant,Yes No,500,000.00             .00

It is an adaptive process intended to identify water management needs in the North Coast and prioritize projects for implementation.

The process of developing, implementing, and refining the NCIRWMP has been and will continue to be one of inclusion. Workshops have been conducted throughout the region and a website was developed to provide information and funding opportunities to the public. Much of the region is classified as a disadvantaged community and several plan participants are representatives from these communities.

The NCIRWMP is currently in development and will be adopted in July 2005.

The lower two-thirds of the drainage area lie in Central Valley uplands, and the upstream portion includes the east slope of the North Coast Mountain Range and Klamath Mountains and the southern slopes of the Trinity Mountains. The mainstem of Cottonwood Creek flows eastward through the valley to the Sacramento River, the confluence lying approximately 16 miles north of Red Bluff. The watershed drains approximately 938 square miles. With an annual runoff of 586,000 acre-feet, Cottonwood Creek is the third largest watershed tributary west of the Sacramento River and the largest undammed tributary in the upper Sacramento River basin.
