This area is highly valued for its diverse and fragile marine ecosystem and for the recreational opportunities it provides. The California Ocean Plan and San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board Basin Plan have both designated the area as having special biological significance that warrants particular protection. The State has designated area beaches as impaired for bacteria. There is a critical need to understand the specific pollutants of concern within the watershed, how they may impact the marine ecosystem and how to implement appropriate, site-specific mitigation measures to protect this marine environment. There is also a need to develop a standard for ocean ecosystem monitoring and assessment for long-term protection.","The objectives for the La Jolla Shores Coastal Watershed Management Plan were established by the project partners to address need to protect the water quality of the Plan area.  The objectives consist of:

1.	Identify water quality pollutants of concerns, their potential sources specific to the coastal watershed, and how they may impact the ASBSs.
2.	Identify, evaluate, and prioritize urban runoff management activities, both structural and non-structural in nature, to address the pollutants of concern.
3.	Develop a model for science-oriented, ecosystem-based ASBS assessment and protection that is transferable to other ASBSs statewide.
4.	Create a user-driven data management system at the core of the watershed plan that serves data providers, analysts, partner agencies and the community, and is transferable statewide.
5.	Encourage stewardship of the ASBSs through a pioneering  public involvement and outreach strategy that utilizes University tools and science.","The La Jolla Shores Coastal Watershed Management Plan is scheduled for adoption prior to January 1, 2007.","San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board, State Water Resources Control Board, California Coastal Commission, California Department of Fish and Game, California Coastal Conservancy, The Ocean Conservancy, Southern California Coastal Water Research Project, Birch Aquarium","Yes"

The Regional Management Group is composed of seven member agencies located in a portion of the Tulare Lake Basin hydrologic area that share a common goal of managing substantial portions of the water resources of the region located north of the Kern River. The region is ideal for regional management due to its use of a common groundwater basin| and its capability to store and transfer water from three major sources of surface supplies: the State Water Project| the Central Valley Project (Friant-Kern Canal) and the Kern River. The Management Group entities have operated the groundwater basin conjunctively with available surface supplies for decades; and have the capacity| ability and programs to store and transfer water for other areas in California.","","","Semitropic Water Storage District","","1101 Central Avenue | Wasco | CA - 93280-0877","35.5830                            Longitude:                          -119.3340","Kern River","Multiple Counties","5F Central Valley Fresno Regional Water Board","499|435.00","214|600.00","714|035.00","Integrated Coastal Watershed Management Planning Grant/Integrated Regional Water Management Planning Grant","No/Yes",".00/499,435.00","Project Director: Authorized Representative from Applicant Organization to execute funding agreement/Project Manager: Day to day contact on this project from Applicant Organization","Wilmar/","Boschman/","/","/","/","Semitropic Water Storage District","","1101 Central Avenue

The IRWMP was configured to be a comprehensive plan encompassing aspects of supply reliability and groundwater management.  The IRWMP meets legislative mandates for UWMP and GWMP.","","","Mojave Water Agency","Water Resources","22450 Headquarters Drive | Apple Valley | CA - 92307","34.830610                            Longitude:                          -116.92698250","UPPER MOJAVE RIVER VALLEY","San Bernardino","State Wide","50|000|000.00","31|400|000.00","81|400|000.00","Integrated Regional Water Management Implementation Step 1 Grant","Yes",".00","Project Director: Authorized Representative from Applicant Organization to execute funding agreement/Project Manager: Day to day contact on this project from Applicant Organization","Kirby/","Brill/","/","/","/","Mojave Water Agency","Water Resources","22450 Headquarters Drive

The main driving force that initiated the formation of the RMG and will facilitate implementation of this IRWMP is the projected reduction in the Region's historical water supplies due to environmental and urban uses outside of the Region.
