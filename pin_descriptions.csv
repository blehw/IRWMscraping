A collaborative watershed approach will be used to institute effective and efficient strategies to address non-point source pollution within this urban watershed that covers areas of the San Diego community of La Jolla and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO).  The Critical Coastal Area planning process will be utilized and expanded to provide a marine ecosystem assessment and monitoring pilot program, an adaptive watershed monitoring plan, and an information management system template that integrates land and ocean data.  The plan will also serve as a model for other efforts statewide to comply with the waste discharge prohibition into ASBS in the California Ocean Plan.","","","The Regents of the University of California","San Diego","9500 Gilman Dr , La Jolla , CA - 92093-0210","32.85                            Longitude:                          -117.25","Penasquitos HU (Scripps HA)","San Diego","9 San Diego Regional Water Board","499,874.00","194,162.00","694,036.00","Integrated Coastal Watershed Management Planning Grant Integrated Regional Water Management Planning Grant,"Yes No,"499,874.00             .00"

In recent years, the cities and communities within the Upper Santa Ana region have experienced significant population growth. The Southern California Association of Governments indicates that population within the Muni service area is projected to increase by almost 63 percent over the next twenty-five years. As the population increases, the demand for water will also increase and, therefore, the local agencies need to work together to cooperatively manage their water resources to ensure their future water needs are met. The water interests in the region are working together to ensure that local water in the region is put to reasonable and beneficial use in a manner that reduces reliance on imported water supply and will achieve the regional water management objectives.","","","San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District","","P.O.

The Regional Management Group is composed of seven member agencies located in a portion of the Tulare Lake Basin hydrologic area that share a common goal of managing substantial portions of the water resources of the region located north of the Kern River. 
The region is ideal for regional management due to its use of a common groundwater basin, and its capability to store and transfer water from three major sources of surface supplies: the State Water Project, the Central Valley Project (Friant-Kern Canal) and the Kern River. The Management Group entities have operated the groundwater basin conjunctively with available surface supplies for decades; and have the capacity, ability and programs to store and transfer water for other areas in California.","","","Semitropic Water Storage District","","1101 Central Avenue , Wasco , CA - 93280-0877","35.5830                            Longitude:                          -119.3340","Kern River","Multiple Counties","5F Central Valley Fresno Regional Water Board","499,435.00","214,600.00","714,035.00","Integrated Coastal Watershed Management Planning Grant Integrated Regional Water Management Planning Grant,"No Yes,".00      499,435.00"
