The County has been working at improving water quality in Clear Lake since the 1960•s. Since 1991, the clarity has increased, partially due to watershed protection measures taken by the County.  Improved water quality will benefit drinking water purveyors that use Clear Lake as a water supply and benefit the local economy.  

Lake County is the head of three watersheds and has limited water supplies for local use.  A majority of the surface water rights within the County have been appropriated by downstream interests, leaving limited water supplies for local use, primarily aquifers which have limited storage capacities.

Groundwater management plan will be adopted by July 1, 2006.","The four major water related issues in the Region include: groundwater overdraft, water supply relibility for current water uses and pending urban development, environmental preservation of existing environmental habitat, and protecting water quality. The Madera Groundwater Subbasin has been identified as a basin in 'Critical Overdraft' for over 25 years.  Current estimates identify the annual overdraft at 100,000 acre-feet per year.  In addition to water supply reliability concerns, the declining groundwater levels may result in poorer groundwater quality, because groundwater quality in the basin decreases with depth.  
The Region is under heavy pressure of urban development.  Existing planned developments require a high level groundwater supply reilability and water quality to meet their future water needs.  With the increasing development, only a few large contiguous areas are available to preserve existing habitat and local wildlife areas.","The objectives for the Plan include improving the Region's long-term water supply reliability, reducing groundwater overdraft and protecting the groundwater basin, protecting and preserving the environmental resources of the Region, and protecting surface water and groundwater quality.  The Plan will help reduce conflicts in the Region by encouraging the local agencies to work together to solve regional water supply issues.  Implementing regional water management strategies will reduce the stress on the San Joaquin River system and improve dry and critical year water supply for the Region.","August 2006","During the intial development of the Regional Water Management Group, The City of Madera and Gravelly Ford Water District expressed an interest in joining the RWMG.

Though the Region usually receives ample winter rain, it lacks extensive groundwater basins or holding facilities to ensure adequate water supply for beneficial uses during the dry summer months. Water shortages occur with increasing frequency, causing conflict between water users and regulatory agencies and among stakeholders with different needs. Most of the Region's water bodies are impaired; these impairments are mostly related to sedimentation and temperature increases resulting from resource extraction, road building, development, and other human activities. Leaking septic tanks and municipal discharges also cause biological impairments. Some municipalities or agencies that are in non-compliance with required water quality standards cannot afford to bring their operations to the required level of compliance. Due to this situation, the Region faces environmental justice issues.","The NCIRWMP objectives are to regionally synchronize local planning processes, institutionalize the regional water management planning framework promoted by the CA State Legislature, provide a basis for coordinated, watershed-based, project planning and implementation, and to produce Phase II of the NCIRWMP. Through implementation of projects that meet local needs and objectives and meet regional and state priorities, we intend to be a model for other WQCB Regions. The NCIRWMP Phase II planning and management activities will move the NC Region towards achieving the following thematic objectives: enhancement of beneficial uses, maintenance of regional cooperation, and recovery of endangered salmonid populations. By pursuing these objectives through implementation of prioritized projects, we intend to facilitate reduction of water-related conflict, promote environmental justice, improve the Region's water quality, and increase water supply to benefit all inhabitants of the Region.","The adoption date of July 12, 2005 for a Regional Water Management Group was formed from mutual interest and benefit and by County Board Resolutions, Modoc County Authorizing Resolution No. 05-26, Humboldt County Authorizing Resolution No. 05-45, Siskiyou County Authorizing Resolution No. 05-94, Sonoma County and Sonoma County Water Agency Authorizing Resolution No.05-0650, Del Norte County Authorizing Resolution No. 05-39 See Attachment 3: Authorizing Documentation.","Currently, over 71 entities have signed the Memorandum of Mutual Understanding (MOMU) indicating their intent to participate in the NCIRWMP Phase I.

City of San Fernando, et al., dated January 26, 1979 (Judgment).  This Judgment creates compliance with CWC Section 10753 regarding groundwater management plans.  The Superior Court appointed a Watermaster of the Upper Los Angeles River Area to administer and enforce the terms of the Judgment on behalf of the Superior Court.  The Watermaster is also responsible for accounting for all groundwater extractions, recharge operations, stored water credits, groundwater quality, and hydrologic condition within the San Fernando Basin.","The water related issues in the region center around water supply, water quality, and moving to sustainable use of water resources within the region. Many other regions need water supplies that Los Angeles has traditionally used. For Los Angeles to maintain growth, it must reduce per capita consumption of water, and effectively utilize its water resources i.e., rainfall, groundwater and recycled water. The majority of the water bodies in the urbanized areas of the region are on the EPA 303D list as impaired due to a variety of pollutants. A TMDL issuance schedule has been mandated and when regulations are promulgated, will dictate the compliance timeframe. In places, brownfields have impaired groundwater. This is against conflicting desires and perceptions by the public from an outcry against groundwater recharge projects to environmentalists demanding that river flows be maintained even if it is utilizing recycled water discharge to restore habitat.","A Draft Version 1 IRWM Plan has been created that analyzed existing plans and studies in the region against the IRWM program guidelines and developed a set of objectives. A screening tool was developed for the preliminary ranking of IRWM projects to carry out the strategies needed to address the objectives. A series of five stakeholder meetings were held during development of the Version 1 Plan that allowed for feedback and submission of projects. Yet a more thorough process is needed to adequately prioritize the objectives and strategies and strongly link these together with the projects.","December 1, 2006","None","Yes",1,1

This plan was prepared, and will be implemented, in accordance with CWC-10753.","The most problematic water issues are described here. 1-Flooding is a major issue in many Northern California counties and Butte County is no exception.  2-Reliable water supplies are not available to many foothill residents in the region. 3-Water transfers of groundwater, or using groundwater in-lieu of surface water is a major issue in the region. Chapter 33 of the Butte County Code requires a permit from the Water Commission for such transfers. 4-Water quality in the region is quite good.  However, water temperature issues remain in managing fisheries and in rice germination. 5-Water use efficiency projects remain valuable in the region. Some old mining flumes and pipes are being gradually replaced with upgraded infrastructure. 6-Ecosystem restoration is exemplified by the many projects along the Sacramento River and in its tributaries. Butte County•s Environmental Monitoring Program will also help estimate the water demands of various in-stream, riparian and terrestrial habitats.","The objectives of the Butte County IRWM Plan include:
1. Removing barriers to local control;
2. Seeking consistency and applicability at the regional level;
3. Protecting water rights;
4. Improving water management;
5. Meeting future in-County water demands;
6. Meeting County urban, agricultural and environmental needs first;
7. Protecting public health and safety;
8. Maintaining and enhancing the economic health of the County;
9. Minimizing third party impacts;
10. Protecting and enhancing biological resources;
11. Improving water quality;
12. Increasing the understanding of existing environmental conditions; and

City of Clovis, City of Dinuba, Fresno Irrigation District and Raisin City Water District are participating in the development of an IRWM plan that meets the requirements of CWC §10753.7","During dry years surface water supplies are often insufficient and the region relies on increased groundwater pumping to meet all the water demands, resulting in storage depletion, overdraft, declining water levels, and loss of groundwater supply in some areas in the eastern part of the Kings Basin. Degradation of water quality in parts of the region has the potential to reduce the available supply or increase treatment costs and migration of poor quality water is a factor in the operation of the groundwater basin. Significant urban development is occurring throughout the region, increasing demands and creating potential for conflicts between water users. Potential conflicts also exist due to inconsistent planning horizons, lack of compatibility between land use and water supply plans, decreased water quality, increased treatment costs and requirements for both drinking water and wastewater treatment.","Water resources objectives have been developed to address priority water supply problems by integrating land, water, and environmental management strategies that will provide multiple benefits and the greatest return on investment. The preliminary water management objectives are: Find regional opportunities for groundwater recharge, water reuse/reclamation, and drinking water treatment; Improve the ability to store available surface and storm water; Provide multi-purpose groundwater recharge facilities that provide flood control, recreation and ecosystem benefits and integrate the fishery management plan; Promote in-lieu groundwater recharge through reclamation and reuse of treated wastewater; Surface water treatment and delivery for drinking water; and untreated water for agricultural use; Design programs to improve water conservation and water use efficiency by all water users; and enhance wildlife habitat through surface water reclamation, recharge, and treatment facilities.","The Kings Basin IRWMP will be adopted by the project participants by January 1,2007 in compliance with the requirements of the Proposition 50, Chapter 8 grant funding.","City of Fowler, Mayor Jim Simonian;City of Kingsburg, City Manager Don Pauley;City of Reedley, Interim City Engineer Bruce Webber; City of Sanger, Deputy Director of Public Works Tim Chapa City of Selma, Community and Volunteer Coordinator Roseann Galvan;City of Kerman, City Manager Ron Manfredi; City of Parlier, City Manager Lou Martinez;County of Fresno, Senior Geologist Phil Desatoff;County of Kings, Board of Supervisor Jon Rachford;County of Tulare, Brian Haddox;Fresno Audubon Society, Joseph Oldman;California Native Plant Society, Warren Shaw;Kings River Fisheries Management Program Public Advisory Group, Hank Urbach;El Rio Reyes Trust, Kent Kinney;California Water Institute, Karl Longely; California Department of Fish & Game, Bill Loudermilk;Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lonnie Wass;Kings River Water Association, Steve Haugen","Yes","N/A",1,1

In summary, MCWRA has implemented programs that addressed the following criteria: The control of saline water intrusion; implementation of a nitrate management plan, identification and management of wellhead protection and recharge areas; administration of a well abandonment and well destruction program; mitigation of conditions of overdraft; replenishment of groundwater extracted by water producers; monitoring of groundwater levels and storage; facilitation of conjunctive use operations; development of local relationships with state and federal regulatory agencies; and review of land use plans and coordination with land use planning agencies to assess activities which create a reasonable risk of groundwater contamination.","The Salinas Valley Region is approximately delineated by the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin (Basin). The Basin has been identified as contaminated with seawater intrusion since 1946. Excess groundwater pumping has led to overdraft and expansion of the seawater intrusion line. In addition, Marina Coast Water District, responsible for the delivery of water to the former Fort Ord, has encountered groundwater contamination issues due to seawater intrusion and volatile organic compounds contamination. The city of Soledad currently disposes its treated wastewater to stabilization ponds. This in turn can lead to nitrate contamination in the groundwater, already exacerbated by the intense 3 billion dollar agricultural business in the Salinas Valley. The proposed projects focus on resolving the above issues.","The Salinas Valley (IRWM) Plan objectives focus on four criteria: water supply, water quality, flood protection and environmental enhancement. A short objectives summary is provided. Water supply objectives are: Stop seawater intrusion, provide sufficient water supply to meet all water needs through the year 2030, optimize conjunctive use and increase groundwater storage. Water quality objectives are: Meet or exceed all applicable water quality regulatory standards, aid in meeting TMDL•s established for the Salinas River watershed, protect surface and groundwater from contamination or threat of contamination. Flood protection objectives are: Preserve flood protection associated with dam operations and work with stakeholders to preserve existing flood channel maintenance program. Environmental enhancement objectives are: Minimize adverse environmental impacts, identify opportunities to protect, enhance, and/or restore natural resources including streams, groundwater and watersheds.","The functionally equivalent plan (FEP) was adopted by the Boards of all member agencies in June of 2005 and is described in detail in attachment # 3.

·Water rights conflicts. Evolving law, water availability, construction delays, and court decisions contribute to conflicts.
·Loss of Habitat and Habitat Degradation. Need water supply for the maintenance of healthy watershed.
·Degradation of water quality. Pollutants from stormwater and dry weather runoff, high levels of bacterial contaminants to the beaches, and reduced groundwater recharge degrade beneficial uses.
·Lack of public awareness of water supply and water quality issues. Education of public to implement  BMPs is a high priority.
·Fragmentation of Regional Programs. Requires coordination to optimize mutually beneficial outcomes and leverage of resources.
·Public Health. Water-borne pathogens breed in agricultural runoff, urban runoff, and natural areas.","Specific objectives to protect communities from drought, protect and improve water quality, and improve local water security by reducing dependence on imported water have been developed by the SDRWMG and have been included in the Plan.  These objectives are listed below and will guide the selection and prioritization of projects.
-Facilitate the integration of programs and strategies for enhancing the region's water supply, water quality, and watersheds.  
-Improve the reliability of the region's imported and local water supplies
-Reduce the region's reliance on imported water
-Protect and enhance the health and viability of the region's watersheds
-Support regional efforts to attain or be consistent with statewide regulatory standards and priorities","November 1, 2006","kaminpour@ci.chula-vista.ca.us

A TMDL has been adopted by the Central Valley RWQCB to address this impairment.   Saline water drainage impacts urban and agricultural diverters from the Delta and requires large water releases from New Melones Reservoir for dilution to meet water quality objectives.  The lack of drainage has created agency conflicts over impacts of saline drainage and ultimate drainage responsibilities, impacts and mitigation.  
Water supply reliability is also a major issue for Unit contractors.  Due to pumping restrictions in the Delta, water supply to agricultural contractors within the Unit is chronically deficient.","Provide reasonable opportunity to advance ecosystem restoration through balanced project implementation.

Implementing agency:  Pleasant Valley Water District","PVWD•s GMP was adopted on 05/09/00, prior to the passage of SB1938 which was incorporated in CWC10753. The 2000 Plan was prepared in accordance with the requirements prescribed in AB3030 (CWC10750 et seq). In 2003 the District was awarded a grant from the Local Groundwater Management Assistance Act (AB303). One task funded by the grant was to update the GMP.

A draft of the updated or revised Plan was prepared in April 2005 to include information collected as part the District•s Groundwater Quality Monitoring Program funded under AB303. The April 2005 GMP includes provisions in order to be in compliance with CWC10753.

The draft is available for review by other agencies. The development of the final plan that meets the requirements of CWC10753.7 will be completed July 2006 within 1 year of the grant application submittal date. The initial review by the Pleasant Valley Water District Board of Directors in anticipated to be conducted late summer 2005.","Current CVP contract supplies for the cities are insufficient to meet their needs and PVWD has no long-term water supply. Expansion of environmental and habitat protection and improvement is limited by scarce water supply and land acquisition. Current groundwater quality in much of Pleasant Valley is of moderate to high salinity making it more costly for treatment for municipal use and having potentially negative impacts when used for irrigation or wildlife habitat. Since groundwater overdraft in the underlying basin is a chronic problem, one objective is to provide sufficient groundwater recharge and conservation to reverse existing conditions. The stream, Arroyo Pasajero, causes periodic flooding and temporary closure of Highway 269 in the I-5 Business Development Corridor. The flooding interrupts transportation and requires costly cleanup.","Groundwater banking would improve water quality in two ways. By importing and banking higher quality surface water, and therefore mixing it with the native groundwater, the resulting groundwater extracted in the future would be of higher quality. Second, it will be possible at times to use surface water directly for wildlife habitat, municipal treatment, and irrigation thus providing an alternative to using lower quality groundwater. Imported surface water could be intentionally recharged to the aquifer for later extraction improving water supply reliability. A part of the purchased surface water supplies could also be used directly for irrigation resulting in less groundwater use. It is estimated the total potential banking capacity in Pleasant Valley to be approximately 1,000,000 acre-feet. Through storm water capture by groundwater banking and resultant infiltration the severity of flooding of the Arroyo Pasajero could be reduced.","Not yet adopted.

Groundwater represents the primary water supply for domestic and agricultural uses with the region. Its extensive use has resulted in groundwater overdraft conditions. Groundwater management remains necessary to address the impacts of region-wide population growth and agricultural needs. Ensuring adequate water supply to the domestic and agricultural uses within the region, as well as for recharge purposes, will mitigate groundwater overdraft. Maximizing the availability and use of surface water reduces the need to pump groundwater. Storm and flood water capture represent an additional opportunity to augment existing surface water supplies and provide water for groundwater recharge.","The primary goal of the District and its regional partners is to maintain the balance of surface and groundwater supplies in the region. The District considers these efforts, including its adopted Groundwater Management Plan, water management agreements and supporting elements to constitute a functionally equivalent IRWM Plan.

Among the pressures is the growing effort to assure the enhancement of environmental resources within the Sacramento River and its tributaries. Majority of California's water supply originates in the Sacramento Valley, which itself remains a major agricultural center, an area of increased urban growth, and a source of habitat for numerous fish and waterfowl species. Although Sacramento Region water users rely primarily on surface water, groundwater is pumped to augment surface supplies, particularly during dry periods. Water requirements in the majority of the Sacramento Region subbasins can be met in normal years, but shortages do occur during dry years. Some entities are anticipated to experience increased shortages in dry periods, with users such as the CVP water service contractors likely to be most affected by contract curtailment provisions.","The Sacramento Region Integrated Regional Water Management Plan contains three main objectives. 1. Integration of water resources management and planning processes in which water interests in the Sacramento Region continue to plan multi-beneficiary programs, projects, and monitoring that will achieve mutual objectives. 2. Institutional and political integration, through which institutional and political alliances of water suppliers and government entities formulate, develop, finance, and implement integrated programs for the common benefit of its members and citizens. In addition, efforts to continue current and building new political alliances with entities outside the region will strengthen long-term working relationships and foster long-term, viable water management solutions. 3. Operational integration to provide for the coordinated management and operation of facilities and resources to generate the greatest possible benefit from the available resources.","Sacramento Valley water users have implemented a number of programs that can be considered functionally equivalent plans and are the building blocks and precursors to the development of the Sacramento Valley Integrated Regional Water Management Plan.  In December 2000, the NCWA Board of Directors adopted a strategy for an "Integrated Water Management and Water Supply Program" that was developed by the water districts and counties throughout the Sacramento Valley.  In 2001, Sacramento Valley water users, Export Water Users and State and Federal agencies entered into an agreement to stay the SWRCB's Phase 8 proceedings and develop a cooperative water management partnership to help meet water quality objectives in the Delta.  In December 2002, more than 40 Sacramento Valley districts executed and thus adopted the Short-Term Settlement Agreement, building upon the effort initiated by the Short-Term Stay Agreement.

A refined Sacramento Valley IRWMP will be adopted by January 1, 2007.","There will be broad outreach efforts to entities in the Sacramento Valley to increase input into the plan and the process.","Yes",1,1

The following six key water management issues emerged from this process:
1) Demand Exceeds Supply. The projected year 2020 water balance shows a water deficit in MWA service area of over 50,000 acre-feet per year. 2) Water Quality. Water quality problems affect drinking water supplies throughout the MWA the region. 3) Overdraft of the Groundwater Basins. Declining groundwater levels occur in all subareas. 4) Riparian Ecosystem Maintenance. 5) Wastewater Infrastructure. Wastewater infrastructure issues affect the two subareas with the largest urban water demands within the Mojave Basin Area. 6) Subarea Interaction. Many subareas within the MWA service area are impacted by activities in other subareas. These impacts include water supply and water quality issues.","The Technical Advisory Committee recommended the following Basin Management Objectives (consistant with GWMP requirements) which the MWA Board of Directors adopted as the basis of the IRWMP included; 1) Balance future water demands with supplies, recognizing the need to: stabilize GW storage balance over long-term hydrologic cycles, protect and restore riparian habitat areas, limit potential for well dewatering, land subsidence, and poor quality water, maintain a sustainable water supply through extended drought periods; and, select projects with likelihood of being implemented.  2) Maximize the overall beneficial use of water throughout MWA by: supplying water is quantity and quality, address demand management issues, distribution of benefits equitably, ensure costs provide greatest benefits, avoid redirect impacts, and identify sustainable funding sources.

The Feather River supplies the State Water Project and supports hydroelectric operations of Pacific Gas & Electric Company, giving the State of California as well as PG&E and its regulators significant interests and responsibilities in the region.  Also, 50 percent of the watershed is owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service, for which watershed enhancement is a central mission.  

With so many competing interests and issues within the region and from outside, the primary challenge is to develop the science, data, and stakeholder coordination - and to identify responsibilities and funding sources - to manage the watershed on a comprehensive basis rather than one stream, one FERC license, or one species at a time.","The IRWM Plan for the Upper Feather River pulls together the many planning activities and projects that have been undertaken in the region over the past two decades. The IRWM partners have reviewed the existing land and water management plans for the Feather River region, identified any conflicts or gaps in planning, and consolidated the different plans into a guiding document with regional perspective.

The specific objectives of the IRWM Plan are to improve local water retention and reduce flood damage and the need to spill reservoirs; improve dry-season base flows; improve water quality to reduce sediment and temperature, meet the Central Valley Basin Plan standards, and satisfy the agricultural waiver program; improve upland vegetation management to improve water quality and water retention and reduce erosion; improve groundwater retention and storage in major aquifers; and be able to accommodate a restored salmon fishery in segments of the Upper Feather River watershed.","The IRWM Plan was adopted through an MOU with an effective date of July 1, 2007.  The MOU was signed by the last party on July 12.","Butte County, Sierra County, City of Portola, California Department of Water Resources, Pacific Gas & Electric Company.","Yes",1,1
