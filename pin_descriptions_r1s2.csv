The Tahoe Sierra Proposal (TSP) will provide lasting watershed benefits and improve integrated water resource management.  The TSP will implement high priority water quality/supply improvement projects by developing strong working partnerships, consolidating efforts, and transferring data and knowledge.  The high priority projects were selected for their geographic scopes; ability to achieve multiple benefits, obtain objectives and meet statewide priorities; and strength of partnership commitments.  The projects listed in this proposal were drawn directly from Table G.1 of the Functional Equivalent IRWMP, thus are consistent with the Tahoe Sierra Plan objectives.","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","No","The applicant and cooperating entities are not in default for any water rights permit requirements, including fee payment.","No","In the Tahoe Sierra region, conflicts over water supply objectives arise from the multiple use of a static water supply.

These conflicts were finally adjudicated by the Federal Alpine Decree of 1980.  On the Truckee River and at Lake Tahoe, a similar Decree has installed a Federal water master to govern the lake levels behind the outlet dam in Tahoe City.  The partnership does not expect any conflicts over water supply objectives due to the designation of the decrees described above.",1,2

This Proposal will directly address this through developing additional water supply, resolving drainage issues for about 100,000 acres of highly saline lands and improving water quality in the San Joaquin River.

Additionally:
Ecosystem Restoration - reduction in selenium loads affecting aquatic and avian life
Environmental and Habitat Protection - reduction in pollutant loads
Water Supply Reliability - Creation of a net water supply benefit of about 58,000 AFY on average and 41,000 AFY in critical years

Water Conservation - irrigation efficiency improvements

This modeling shows also that in dry years about 23,000 AF of water would otherwise be available in New Melones Reservoir for other purposes due to a reduction in the need for water quality releases from this reservoir due to implementation of the Westside Regional Drainage Plan.

Conjunctive water management projects include groundwater production wells, recharge, and monitoring to ensure that local needs are met in a sustainable manner while helping to protect and enhance the ecosystem and meet water quality standards and water supply needs in other parts of the State. Elements of these projects were developed by local proponents to provide broad local, regional, and statewide water supply reliability, and water quality benefits as well as increased Sacramento River flows. System improvement projects include water district improvements to increase water use efficiency, improve system automation, increase local supplies, and generally improve water management to assist in improving water quality and reliability and reduce river and stream diversions.","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Nine of the projects contained in this Proposal were conceived as part of the Sacramento Valley Water Management Agreement (SVWMA) that will "reduce conflict between water users or resolve water rights disputes, including interregional water rights issues." This Proposal is the first major step in implementation of the SVWMA and development of long-term resolution of water rights disputes among Sacramento Valley right holders and Delta exporters. In 2002, more than 40 water suppliers in the Sacramento Valley negotiated and executed the SVWMA with the Bureau of Reclamation, DWR, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the State Water Project Contractors. The SVWMA provides a framework for resolution of water rights disputes in the Sacramento Valley and offers a means of developing additional water supply to help meet Delta water quality standards.",1,2

Projects herein support the existing conjunctive use program and thereby reduce regional water conflicts.  For example, the Freeport Regional Water Project solves a 30-year-old conflict between Sacramento County Water Agency (SCWA) and East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) over EBMUD's original plan to withdraw water from the American.  The resolution involves moving the withdrawal off the American and onto the Sacramento River, and sharing that withdrawal facility with SCWA (which currently relies solely on groundwater).",1,2
