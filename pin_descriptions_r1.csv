The California Ocean Plan and San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board Basin Plan have both designated the area as having special biological significance that warrants particular protection. The State has designated area beaches as impaired for bacteria. There is a critical need to understand the specific pollutants of concern within the watershed, how they may impact the marine ecosystem and how to implement appropriate, site-specific mitigation measures to protect this marine environment. There is also a need to develop a standard for ocean ecosystem monitoring and assessment for long-term protection.","The objectives for the La Jolla Shores Coastal Watershed Management Plan were established by the project partners to address need to protect the water quality of the Plan area.  The objectives consist of:

1.	Identify water quality pollutants of concerns, their potential sources specific to the coastal watershed, and how they may impact the ASBSs.
2.	Identify, evaluate, and prioritize urban runoff management activities, both structural and non-structural in nature, to address the pollutants of concern.
3.	Develop a model for science-oriented, ecosystem-based ASBS assessment and protection that is transferable to other ASBSs statewide.
4.	Create a user-driven data management system at the core of the watershed plan that serves data providers, analysts, partner agencies and the community, and is transferable statewide.

The Bureau of Sanitation does not submit a separate plan.","The water related issues in the region center around water supply, water quality, and moving to sustainable use of water resources within the region.  Many other regions need water supplies that Los Angeles has traditionally used. For Los Angeles to maintain growth, it must reduce per capita consumption of water, and effectively utilize its water resources i.e., rainfall, groundwater and recycled water.  The majority of the water bodies in the urbanized areas of the region are on the EPA 303D list as impaired due to a variety of pollutants.  A TMDL issuance schedule has been mandated and when regulations are promulgated, will dictate the compliance timeframe.  In places, brownfields have impaired groundwater. This is against conflicting desires and perceptions by the public from an outcry against groundwater recharge projects to environmentalists demanding that river flows be maintained even if it is utilizing recylced water discharge to restore habitat.","A Draft Version 1 IRWM Plan has been created that analyzed existing plans and studies in the region against the IRWM program guidelines and developed a set of objectives.  A screening tool was developed for the preliminary ranking of IRWM projects to carry out the strategies needed to address the objectives. A series of five stakeholder meetings were held during development of the Version 1 Plan that allowed for feedback and submission of projects.  Yet a more thorough process is needed to adequately prioritize the objectives and strategies and strongly link these together with the projects.  Thus the objective of this planning grant request is to continue the process that has been initiated, prioritize objectives and strategies, further develop project  conceptualization, and reach a larger cross-section of stakeholders, to more fully formulate the plan.","December 1, 2006","None","Yes",1,

Among the pressures is the growing effort to assure the enhancement of environmental resources within the Sacramento River and its tributaries. Majority of California's water supply originates in the Sacramento Valley, which itself remains a major agricultural center, an area of increased urban growth, and a source of habitat for numerous species.  
Although Sacramento Region water users rely primarily on surface water, groundwater is pumped to augment surface supplies, particularly during dry periods.  Water requirements in the majority of the Sacramento Region subbasins can be met in normal years, but shortages do occur during dry years.  Some entities are anticipated to experience increased shortages in dry periods, with users such as the CVP water service contractors likely to be most affected by contract curtailment provisions.","The Sacramento Region Integrated Regional Water Management Plan contains three main objectives.

1. Integration of water resources management and planning processes in which water interests in the Sacramento Region continue to plan multi-beneficiary programs, projects, and monitoring that will achieve mutual objectives.
2. Institutional and political integration, through which institutional and political alliances of water suppliers and government entities formulate, develop, finance, and implement integrated programs for the common benefit of its members and citizens.  In addition, efforts to continue current and building new political alliances with entities outside the region will strengthen long-term working relationships and foster long-term, viable water management solutions.
3. Operational integration to provide for the coordinated management and operation of facilities and resources to generate the greatest possible benefit from the available resources.","By January 1, 2007","None","Yes",1,

Groundwater is a primary water supply source in the Santa Ana Watershed, but it is threatened by degrading groundwater quality mostly due to high total dissolved solids and nitrates. WMWD and its member agencies are considering a number of projects as part of a regional integrated plan for the Watershed to treat and distribute degraded groundwater to provide an additional source of drinking water and help protect existing groundwater supplies to meet future demands. These types of projects become vital region-wide components to reduce the expanding demand on imported water.","To protect the Western Municipal Water District service area from droughts, improve water quality, and improve local water security by reducing dependence on imported water, the following objectives for the IRWM Plan are proposed:

Programs for water supply reliability, water conservation, and water use efficiency; groundwater recharge and management projects; contaminant and salt removal through reclamation, desalting, and other treatment technologies;
water banking, water exchange, water reclamation, and improvement of water quality; and watershed management planning and implementation.","March 2007","None","Yes",1,

Because of this the Upper Bay is closed to body contact and is severely restricted for fishing. Four TMDLs have been enacted for this watershed and resulted in it's listing as a Critical Coastal Area. Urban runoff has been the identified as a major contributor to water quality degradation, which impacts habitat, beneficial uses, and groundwater interfaces. Water conservation through improved recycling and groundwater basin recharge are two primary goals for water supply issues in this watershed.

The majority of the members of the CBWA have indicated their support of conjunctive use projects in the Basin.  

A dependable long term supply of imported treated and untreated water from the MWD is no longer assured.  Local storage suppolies must be developed to address this problem.

Groundwater quality problems have become more prevalent over the last few years as new contaminants migrate into the underground aquifers, and MCL's have been reduced by DHS and EPA.

In the highly urbanized Los Angeles area, sites for new water wells and treatment plants are becoming more difficult to locate and more expensive to purchase.","It is estimated that the Central Basin currently has 300,000 acre-feet of available storage space.  Central Basin water purveyors are currently involved in a process of developing a conjunctive use groundwater storage program that is both beneficial and agreeable to all entities holding water rights within the Basin.  This project will provide one alternative for those qualified parties to participate in the conjunctive use program.

In addition to the conjunctive use aspect of this project, a new treatment plant will be utilized to remove contaminants (primarily VOC's) from the groundwater when the groundwater is extracted for use in the City.

We chose this region for a Sierra Meadows IRWMP for several reasons. 1) The watersheds in the region face similar issues including: the legacy of mining and its impact on water quality and river health; downstream and out-of-basin demands; and accelerated erosion causing meadows to drain, lowering the water table. 2) The small, rural communities here will define different strategies for IRWM issues than in urban or fast-growing suburban areas. 3) Much of the land in these headwaters is publicly owned, so public land agencies, particularly the USFS and BLM, play a critical role in management of these meadow systems. 4) There are thousands of small reservoirs in this planning area, whose re-operation could foster sustainable management of meadows for a range of uses.","The overall planning objective for the Sierra Meadows IRWMP is to identify and develop integrated Sierra Meadow strategies and projects that meet multiple objectives of water quality, water supply, and environmental enhancement. Some of the initial strategies will be implemented as a result of the studies and analyses that are part of this proposed planning process, whereas others will likely be recommended for implementation by the Plan itself. The water supply objective is to provide reliable and secure water supply through strategic Sierra Meadow management and restoration. The water quality objective is to protect and improve water quality through strategic Sierra Meadow management and restoration. The environmental and habitat protection objective is to protect and restore ecological services associated with Sierra Meadows. These objectives are designed to address statewide priorities, CALFED's goals, and the Non-Point Source Implementation Plan's goals.","The anticipated adoption date for the Sierra Meadows IRWMP is November 15, 2007","Pit Watershed: Pit River Watershed Alliance; Fall River Wild Trout Foundation; Modoc, Lassen, Shasta, and Siskiyou County RCDs; Fall River Resource Conservation District Goose Lake RCD; Pit RCD; and Shasta , Lassen, and Modoc County Farm Bureaus.

Groundwater represents the primary water supply in the region and its extensive use has resulted in groundwater overdraft conditions. Continued overdraft is resulting in adverse community impacts, such as increased pumping costs and loss of well capacity.  The agencies of the region struggle with maintaining the availability and affordability of their water supplies for both domestic and agricultural purposes.
Availability and use of local and imported surface waters has always been affected by annual variations. This condition is typically managed through water purchases and exchanges and groundwater pumping. This situation has been exacerbated recently by a 70 percent reduction in the region's only reservoir due to dam safety concerns. Subsequently, local surface waters are being under utilized, as poor timing correlation between available water supply and agricultural demands exists.","A regional plan that integrates existing and proposed water management strategies is needed and warranted for the optimized reasonable beneficial use of the water resources of the Tule River region. The principal objectives for the adopted IRWM plan will be to address needs, opportunities and conflicts within the region regarding water supply, groundwater management, environmental resources such as habitat/ecosystem restoration and water quality.
Specific objectives for the IRWM Plan will be: to accomplish and maintain region-wide stakeholder participation and communication during implementation; to coordinate local planning and water management efforts; to continue collection, compilation, and maintenance of sufficient regional data and information to support implementation; to identify and implement strategies that achieve the IRWM Plan's objectives; to identify and support potential projects for implementation; and to monitor and evaluate IRWM Plan performance.","December 29, 2006","- Pixley Irrigation District

Sediment and turbidity may also be at unacceptable levels. One challenge is meeting agricultural water demands during the summer. There are several reservoirs in the watershed, but in drought years, many ranchers and farmers in the lower portion of the watershed do not receive water. The restoration of meadow streams and creeks in the upper portions of the watershed would help with this issue. Several fish and wildlife species dependent on riparian and wetland habitats are endemic, or near-endemic, to the watershed including the Modoc sucker, Goose Lake redband, willow flycatcher, and greater sandhill crane. Wetlands and riparian areas provide flood control, ground water recharge, erosion control, and plant and wildlife habitat and their restoration is vital to a healthy ecosystem, community, and economy.","The WMS will identify those issues that are currently limiting or threatening watershed health and important beneficial water uses, better understand what is causing that limitation or threat, identify actions which would eliminate or lessen watershed problems, and garner broad support from the watershed community for that plan of action.  The WMS would include: a) water quality improvement; b) water supply needs for sustainable agriculture, instream flow, and protection/enhancement of aquatic habitat, aquatic species, and recreation; c) protection and enhancement of important aquatic and terrestrial habitat areas, including watercourses, wetlands, marshland, meadows, and upland habitat; d) control of noxious species, including juniper proliferation; and e) restoration needs and opportunities to improve natural channel function and floodplain utilization, reduce channel erosion and instability, and modify hydrology so as to reduce peak flood flows and increase summer time base flows.","January 1, 2007","Hot Springs Irrigation District and

Though the Region usually receives ample winter rain, it lacks extensive groundwater basins or holding facilities to ensure adequate water supply for beneficial uses during the dry summer months. Water shortages occur with increasing frequency, causing conflict between water users and regulatory agencies and among stakeholders with different needs.

Most of the Region's water bodies are impaired; these impairments are mostly related to sedimentation and temperature increases resulting from resource extraction, road building, development, and other human activities. Leaking septic tanks and municipal discharges also cause biological impairments.  Some municipalities or agencies that are in non-compliance with required water quality standards cannot afford to bring their operations to the required level of compliance.  Due to this situation, the Region faces environmental justice issues.","The NCIRWMP objectives are to regionally synchronize local planning processes, institutionalize the regional water management planning framework promoted by the CA State Legislature, provide a basis for coordinated, watershed-based, project planning and implementation, and to produce Phase II of the NCIRWMP. Through implementation of projects that meet local needs and objectives and meet regional and state priorities, we intend to be a model for other WQCB Regions.

The NCIRWMP Phase II planning and management activities will move the NC Region towards achieving the following thematic objectives: enhancement of beneficial uses, maintenance of regional cooperation, and recovery of endangered salmonid populations. By pursuing these objectives through implementation of prioritized projects, we intend to facilitate reduction of water-related conflict, promote environmental justice, improve the Region's water quality, and increase water supply to benefit all inhabitants of the Region.","The North Coast Integration Regional Water Management Plan Phase I will be adopted in July 2005.","Currently, 71 entities have signed the Memorandum of Mutual Understanding (MOMU) indicating their intent to participate in the NCIRWMP Phase I.

For example, flood control is more focused on erosion control, or managing the watershed for retention, rather than controlled flows within levees for minimizing flood water damage.  Water quality issues are more heavily influenced by old mining activities, recreational use, and wild fires, rather than the more typical agricultural issues seen in the Central Valley.  Much of the existing water supply infrastructure was developed for power generation and mining operations, and then later adopted for public water supply and environmental purposes.  Climate change is predicted by some to shrink the Sierra snow pack in the future.  Another example is groundwater, where fractured rock aquifers are not well understood, instead of valley aquifers where recharge rates, conjunctive use, and sustained yields have been better studied.","The intent of the CABY IRWMP is to address the four primary resource area objectives: water supply, water quality, groundwater management, and environmental and habitat protection.
