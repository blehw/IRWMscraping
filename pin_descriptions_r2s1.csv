This decline will result in an increase in the use of power and energy resources to pump groundwater, creating both an environmental and economic burden. This economic burden will be felt by all uses that rely in whole or in part on pumped groundwater --- whether use is for agricultural, municipal, or industrial purposes. All of the communities within the Region are economically-disadvantaged communities that rely exclusively on groundwater for their municipal drinking water source.  If conflict over reduced water supplies is to be avoided, actions to mitigate the reduction in surface water supplies available to the Region must be taken.","The Plan objectives include...
1. Maintain and improve water supply reliability;(based on the findings of this Plan, this objective means to mitigate the projected loss to water supply reliability since it may not be possible to improve beyond the historical condition)

3. Protect the quality of groundwater and enhance where practical;
4. Maintain water supply costs at a level commensurate with the continued viability of the agricultural economy which has developed in the region;

An ICWM Plan was developed using a collaborative and integrated watershed approach to outline effective and efficient management measures that will address threats to the ASBS within the urban coastal watershed that discharges to the ASBS.   The ICWM Plan integrates watershed water quality data with ASBS ecosystem assessment findings to identify the watershed pollutants most likely to negatively impact the ASBS.  Management measures are then identified and prioritized, and a phased implementation program is established.","","","The Regents of the University of California","San Diego","9500 Gilman Dr , La Jolla , CA - 92093-0210","32.85","-117.25","Penesguitos HU (Scripps HA)","San Diego","9 San Diego Regional Water Board","IRWM Implementation Grant, Round 2, Step 1 Program","Yes",".00","Project Director: Authorized Representative from Applicant Organization to execute funding agreement/Project Manager: Day to day contact on this project from Applicant Organization","Douglas/Hampel","Bennett/Julie","858-534-2832/858-534-1563","858-822-2718/858-534-1564","dbennett@ucsd.edu/jhampel@ucsd.edu","The Regents of the University of California","San Diego","9500 Gilman Dr

The most critical project to help solve these issues is the Los Osos Community Wastewater Project.   The Santa Maria Groundwater Basin has been adjudicated, with seawater intrusion concerns.   Multiple 303(d) listings exist for Nipomo Creek, Oso Flaco Creek, Oso Flaco Lake, and the Santa Maria River.  Mechanisms to fund vital flood control projects, especially in the disadvantaged community of Oceano, prove challenging.

Additional conservation measures are developed while the state faces uncertainties in water supply deliveries resulting from the current Delta smelt crisis.
Metropolitan works aggressively with its member agencies to develop, improve and implement water management strategies to to maximize conservation savings for the immediate future to better prepare for uncertain conditions.  One important strategy is to
extend extraordinary conservation measures and programs to reduce supply demands.","The objective of the plan is to distribute 5,000 residential and up to 200 commercial weather based irrigation controllers through Metropolitan's service area.  The goal is to help influence an eventual market transformation, and to save water in the landscape sector where potential is largely untapped by replacing standard controllers with weather-based irrigation controllers.  Other benefits of the program would be reduction in urban runoff from reduced over watering of landscapes.","All major stakeholders are identified and listed.",,"Yes",2,1,No,,
