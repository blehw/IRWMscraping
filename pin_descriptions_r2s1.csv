This decline will result in an increase in the use of power and energy resources to pump groundwater, creating both an environmental and economic burden. This economic burden will be felt by all uses that rely in whole or in part on pumped groundwater --- whether use is for agricultural, municipal, or industrial purposes. All of the communities within the Region are economically-disadvantaged communities that rely exclusively on groundwater for their municipal drinking water source.  If conflict over reduced water supplies is to be avoided, actions to mitigate the reduction in surface water supplies available to the Region must be taken.","The Plan objectives include...
1. Maintain and improve water supply reliability;(based on the findings of this Plan, this objective means to mitigate the projected loss to water supply reliability since it may not be possible to improve beyond the historical condition)
2. Maintain groundwater levels at economically viable pumping lifts;
3. Protect the quality of groundwater and enhance where practical;
4. Maintain water supply costs at a level commensurate with the continued viability of the agricultural economy which has developed in the region;

An ICWM Plan was developed using a collaborative and integrated watershed approach to outline effective and efficient management measures that will address threats to the ASBS within the urban coastal watershed that discharges to the ASBS.   The ICWM Plan integrates watershed water quality data with ASBS ecosystem assessment findings to identify the watershed pollutants most likely to negatively impact the ASBS.

-Existing imbalance of areas oh high and low groundwater
-Pending imbalance of supply and demand due to planned growth
-Exisitng and pending inability to adequately dispose of wastewater
-Frequent reduction of long-term imported water supplies and lower quality local supplies.

Water Quality

-Increased total disolved solids (TDS) salts are accumulating in the basin and constrain beneficial uses
-Hardness affects urban supplies and leads to water softeners that further add salts to the basin
-Nitrates have accumulated in some groundwater sub-basins, affecting beneficial uses
-Effective water quality protection is lacking

Lack of adequate surface water; 
Groundwater overdraft; 
Migration of saline groundwater;

Expansion of agriculture into historically un-irrigated areas; 
Sustainability of economies dependent water supply; 
Flood protection; and 
Funding and financing.

Because the Management Area is part of a regional aquifer system, integrated regional solutions are essential to solve key regional issues while avoiding or minimizing conflict.  No one solution will fully address the underlying issues facing the area.  The solution requires an integrated mix of water management strategies. Failure to address water supply and management needs will ultimately result in severe social, economic, and environmental disruptions to the Region.","IRWMP Chapter 5 displays the Plan statements of the problem, GBA mission, Plan purpose, objectives, and values, plus evaluation and prioritization criteria.  These are considered in the Plan as a hierarchy, such that each level must address an aspect of the levels above.  Groundwater overdraft and resulting saline water migration threaten the sustainability and reliability of the region's water supply.  The GBA Coordinating Committee developed the following statement of the Fundamental Objectives (p.5-3):
It is the Objective of the GBA to: Ensure the long-term sustainability of water resources in the San Joaquin Region while: 
Equitably distributing benefits and costs; Minimizing adverse impacts to agriculture, communities, and the environment; Maximizing efficiency and beneficial use of supplies; and, Protecting and enhancing water rights and supplies.

It is comprised of five subsheds that all drain into the Tomales Bay: the Tomales Bay subshed, Walker Creek subshed, Tomales Bay Eastshore subshed, Tomales Bay Westshore subshed, and the Lagunitas subshed.  

The second watershed in the Plan area is the Pt. Reyes National Seashore watershed.  Creeks in this watershed drain to the Pacific Ocean and also include three relatively small subsheds associated with the ASBS areas (Pt. Reyes Headland Reserve and Extension, Double Point, and Duxbury Reserve and Extension).","The majority if the plan area is in Marin County, and a very small portion of the north-eastern Tomales Bay watershed is in Sonoma County (upper portions of Walker Creek subshed).","The San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board encompasses the entire plan area.","No/The TBWC ICWMP will be adopted by all four water agencies and the full Tomales Bay Watershed Council organization beginning 9/18/07 and ending 10/25/07.  The TBWC Foundation Board--the governing body for TBWC--will finalize the process by adopting the document on October 25, 2007.","All projects included in this plan are located in Northern California.","The major water related issues are: 

Water supply- water supply reliability, balancing needs for water, water quality/safe drinking water, agricultural water supply reliability, and global climate change.  

Groundwater management- groundwater conditions, groundwater quality, and groundwater management.  

Water quality- impaired water quality, impacts to beneficial uses, pathogens, mercury, sedimentation, nutrients, on-site sewage disposal systems, and ASBS areas.  

Storm water and flood management- municipal storm water management, flood management, impervious surfaces, and water supply interruption. 

Ecosystems and habitat- Tomales Bay, habitat and special status species protection, freshwater flows, Coho salmon and steelhead recovery, fishery spawning and sedimentation, wetlands, riparian habitat, and exotic species.   

Watershed management- water quality monitoring, fishery monitoring, landuse practices, partnerships, and additional data needs/data gaps.","The Plan identified five programmatic goals (water quality, environmental restoration and habitat improvement, water supply reliability, stormwater and flood management, and groundwater management) as well as an overarching guiding approach (sound resource and watershed management). 

Each goal has at least three objectives to direct implementation and project development. In the aggregate, the objectives ensure water quality is sufficient to support natural resources and sustain beneficial uses, that natural habitats and native communities are restored and preserved, that stormwater and flood management programs and measures are sound and environmentally sensitive, that groundwater supplies are managed and protected, and that sound water resource management processes and infrastructure are met while balancing the diverse water needs of the region.","The Tomales Bay Watershed Council is comprised of 32 member groups, including all four regional water agencies with service area boundaries in the region. TBWC members include federal, state, and local agencies with regulatory or management authority in the region, local organizations, and non-profit organizations with a programmatic focus in the plan area.  The stakeholders in the TBWC have been working together since 2000 and have jointly produced the Tomales Bay Watershed Stewardship Plan, which is the precursor document to the ICWMP.  Therefore all agencies and organizations that participate in resource management decisions in the region will continue to participate in the planning process, and in implementation of the plan recommendations.","IRWM Water Management Round 2 Grant Program Guidelines: II Introduction and Overview: C Maximum Grant Amount

Though the Region usually receives ample winter rain, it lacks extensive groundwater basins or holding facilities to ensure adequate water supply for beneficial uses during the dry summer months. Water shortages occur with increasing frequency, causing conflict between water users and regulatory agencies and among stakeholders with different needs. Most of the Region's water bodies are impaired; these impairments are mostly related to sedimentation and temperature increases resulting from resource extraction, road building, development, and other human activities. Leaking septic tanks and municipal discharges also cause biological impairments. Some municipalities or agencies that are in non-compliance with required water quality standards cannot afford to bring their operations to the required level of compliance. As a result, this disadvantaged Region faces environmental justice issues.","The NCIRWMP objectives are to regionally synchronize local inland and coastal planning processes, institutionalize the regional water management planning framework promoted by the CA State Legislature, provide a basis for coordinated, watershed-based, project planning and implementation, and to produce ongoing, adaptive phases of the NCIRWMP. Through implementation of projects that meet local needs and objectives and meet regional and state priorities, we intend to be a model for other DWR and RWQCB Regions. The integrated coastal management activities put forth in this proposal will further progress towards the following thematic objectives: enhancement of beneficial uses, maintenance of regional cooperation, and recovery of endangered salmonid populations. The proposal promotes environmental justice, improves the Region's water quality, reduces pollution to ASBS and CCAs to benefit all inhabitants of the Region.","Currently, 71 entities have signed the Memorandum of Mutual Understanding (MOMU) indicating their intent to participate in the NCIRWMP Phase I. These entities include 16 municipalities, several Resource Conservation Districts, 2 tribal agencies, numerous CSDs, Water Agencies and Sanitary Districts, and many non-profit and community-based organizations.
